Oh yeah, there's a couple groups that do the studies through Craigslist. Alright, perfect. So this is showing that you're being recorded. Can I play it now? This is also being recorded so we can get started. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm doing good. Thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles. Really? Me too. Oh, great. Where do you live? I live in West Los Angeles, the west side. Nice. How do you like your living situation? It's alright. No, I live alone. That's great. How do you like LA? I love it. I'm from here, so I grew up here. It's natural. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. Well, the weather. It's always good. It's never bad. There's There's always something to do. It's rarely a dull moment. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic. I see what you mean. The traffic is horrible.

No, I've been done for a few years, so I haven't gone to school for a while. One of these days, I'll go back to graduate school. Awesome. What's your dream job? My dream job would be to just work for myself and make lots of money. I don't know, I don't really have a dream job. It's just something that I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and be in a creative environment. How hard is that? I don't know. It's just a matter of finding the right situation. Right now, people are a little conservative about what they want and how they want it, so it's a little tougher than it should be, but I don't know. I think when the situation's right, I don't think it's too difficult. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What do you do now? I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency. So I just basically get sent out to do desk jobs. Are you happy to do that? Yes and no. I mean, I feel like I could do more, but, you know, it works. So, you know. How close are you to your family? I'm pretty close. I mean, they're around, so. What are some things that make you really mad? Um, god, really mad? Stupid people just basically doing, just doing anything to annoy me. Um, that's big, that's the big thing. Just, just irritating, stupid people who just do things just to provoke, provoke me for no reason at all. Can you give me an example of that? What's a good example? Just random people who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me. It doesn't have to be one, any specific situation. It's just people who just think it's funny. I think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's funny to just prod you. like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just want to push your buttons for no reason so when was the last time it happened uh god i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember when when it happens i just i just let it go and it's like the past is the past I just tend not to look back what do you mean okay and what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym listen to music I I have a lot of musician friends, so I just, so I'm usually around musicians, so anything of that sort. I like, I like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's, that's generally art and creative. Awesome. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Who's been a positive? I think it's just friends in general who seem to do well, and I think they're very inspiring, which is sometimes a bit tough in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals. So it's sometimes hard to find someone who's going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring. So I don't really have anybody in particular, but people have kind of brought up things here and there. Like what? You know, it's like, hey, instead of doing this, how about doing that? Or, hey, you're good at this, why aren't you doing that? Or something like that. I'm always looking for new opportunities, so they always point out things that maybe I could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time um I guess it depends on who you talk to I'm I'm okay at it I could probably work at that. I don't know. I mean, I can, I think I could do better at it. Can you give me an example of that? Well, back to the point about people provoking me. So, I mean, I try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin. So, I just usually try not to let it get to me. But I don't know. I guess with temper, I guess it depends on how I handle my stress. Lately, I've been better at it just because I think my situation's been a little bit better. That's good. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you ever served in the military? No. Okay. Is there anything you regret? Nothing major. I mean, maybe when I was younger, I could have traveled more or I could have worked towards something that paid better job wise. But I mean, those are all things that I think at any point in life, you always think like, well, I could have, should have, would have done. But, you know, but then again, I think that's natural for anybody. I mean, I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that I make now, but then again, I don't like the law and I don't like medicine, so it wasn't meant to be. Yeah. Yeah. What made you decide to do that? I think in my life I knew that there's a lot of things, there's more dislikes than likes, so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and who will I not work well with. So I kind of sorted it out, and then the list kind of answered itself. That sounds really hard. No, I don't think it was hard, but I think it was a real reality check, and I think it's kind of a good thing because sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense. It's like trying to shove a round peg into a square hole, and it's like it's just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not going to go in so sometimes it's just you might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences um Um, hmm. I think it's just, I don't really have like any one in particular. I think, I think every day is almost like a memorable experience, whether it's positive or negative. I think it's just everything from getting it. Just, just the fact that I got a job and I can, I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience. Maybe for the average person it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I'm able I'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so I feel like I've gotten somewhere maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. I'm not really someone who's like, I don't have any real high highs or low lows. I mean, I haven't hit any lows. I mean, I don't know. I'm usually pretty, I feel like I'm a level person. Every day I feel like if I accomplish one thing, then I'm pretty happy. So I guess to answer the question, probably yesterday. I just feel like if I'm able to accomplish something, then, hey, I'm happy. That's great. How would your best friend describe you? I don't know. I don't really have a best friend, but, I mean, well, to answer the question, generally friends. I think they would say that I'm pretty outgoing. I'm pretty determined. I'm trying, you know, I try to interact as much as possible. I'm always out networking as much as possible. So, I don't know. I guess that's basically what I think they would describe me as. Okay. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. No problem. Goodbye. All right. Bye. You all done? Yeah. Okay, great. So I'm going to shut all this down, and then we just have a quick closer look for you, okay? Okay. That was weird. Should I unplug this?",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/301_P/301_AUDIO.wav,0
302,28,1," Okay, there you go. So if you can just move around a little bit for me so that the Xbox can make the noise. There we go. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. When you're finished, you can go ahead and ring the store bell. Yep, one minute, one minute. She's done. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm fine. How about yourself? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles, California. Really? Me too. What part? Why don't we talk about it a little later? Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? All my family's here, friends, a mixture of people, and a lot of things to do. Okay. What'd you study at school? Early childhood education. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it. Why? I love working with kids, seeing them smile. Tell me more about that. I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life. What's your dream job? Working with kids as a school teacher or in that capacity. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it would always be fun. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. Sometimes too close. Can you give me an example of that? I have four sisters and one brother on my mom's side. And on my dad's side I have six brothers and four sisters. And we are intertwined together. So that's why I say we're too close sometimes. I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No. Why? I have a lot of friends that I interact with and we're always doing different things so that's why I say I'm not. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? Curse. Just let it out. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? A couple days ago. My nephew didn't call me back. How did you feel in that moment? Uh, kinda mad, cause I had set aside some time to spend with him and he just blew it off and didn't call me back. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah, I know. How are you at controlling your temper? Um, I'm okay. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When my mother passed. I'm sorry. Tell me more about that. It's been about five years now to the day. It's getting better. Time makes it easier. That's good. Do you feel down? A lot. Do you feel down? A lot. Because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis. Yeah. Like what? Anything. Driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, watching different TV shows, just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? Yesterday. Yesterday? Hmm. How do you cope with that? Think about the good times and don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not officially, but I think I might be depressed. Tell me more about that. Well, I mean, since my mom passed, it's been kind of rough. And then, um, job situation's not stable here in California, so that has a lot to do with it as well, so... That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but... Have you ever seen any changes in her behavior or thoughts lately? Kinda, sorta. Kinda just to myself. Reserve. Mm-hmm. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Not really. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Grumpy, irritable, fidgety, big ball of nerves. Do you travel a lot? Uh, what do you mean? Whatever comes to your mind. Uh, I guess so, yeah. I like to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people, different locations, scenery. different opportunities to try something new in a new location. Awesome. I'd love to hear about your trips. I just came back from Memphis about three weeks ago. Going to see family and friends. It was pretty nice. got a chance to see something new change the scenery what advice would you give yourself Wow stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right just go straight ahead just different circumstances in life that gradually push me towards the left and the right every day. Is there anything you regret? A few relationships, not staying in school, missing out on great opportunities with employers. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party. How do you know them? Grew up together in the same community. Went to school together, high school friends. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My big sister, Michelle. My friend, Troy. I mean, there's others, but those two, no matter good or bad, they're always in my corner for me. Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy? Yesterday. Yesterday. I celebrated his birthday. Aww. That's great. I'd love to hear all about it. It was just a little small, intimate setting. We cooked a meal. have family and friends over, listen to music, watch movies, talk about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one unit. So it's just a nice evening. Yeah, that's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Whoa. Was the screen like that the whole time? Uh, while I was talking. It was? Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. That's very bizarre. I've never seen you do that before. Have to do it over? No.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/302_P/302_AUDIO.wav,1
303,17,1," Okay, there you are. Wow. You won't see yourself this whole time. Okay. So I'm just going to move around so I can activate the connect, which is what's recording your body. Okay. So there we go. Perfect. And now we can get started. When you're finished, when she's done, we'll get this so that I know that it's complete. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi. I'm . Thanks for coming in today. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Okay, how about yourself? I'm great, thanks. Where are you from originally? Here in California. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Oh, well, that it's big and broad. It's a lot to do, a lot of job opportunities than other states. Pretty much that it's big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can, you know, look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. What did you study at school? Sociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, I'm actually an MTA bus operator. What's your dream job? Well, since Metro is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company. I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So, because they look to promote within the company, so that's a good thing. things, a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature. That sounds like a great situation. Thanks. How hard is that? Well, it's not actually hard. Right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now because they look to promote within so, you know, since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need, that you're interested in, go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. That makes sense. Do you consider yourself an introvert? What do you mean? I'm sorry. Let's come back to that later. Okay. What do you do to relax? Read, take a long walk, hot bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes. Okay. How are you at I'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. How hard is that? Well I look at it like it it goes with it I mean it comes with experience you know do something on a continuous basis, usually you, somewhere down the line, you become good at it, you know. So I look at it like that. So I've been driving for years and dealing with the public. So it's just how you handle circumstances. You know, you treat people like you want to be treated. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. I'm pretty good at it now. Maybe when I were younger, you know. You, as you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things, and I'm still learning today. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say my family, you know, my kids, you know, even though, you know, I had been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience, you know, you born here, but you got to leave here one day. But my kids will keep me, you know, sane and, you know, I love them and my family. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Setting good examples, you know, because you're the first teacher, you know, and you want to set a positive good example for your kids. And I think that's a good thing and it starts at home. Can you give me an example of that? Well, by you being the first teacher, your kids, you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. So whatever's being taught in the home, they looking and learning every day. You know, whether it's at home, school, you know, kids have a tendency to do things what they see, you know what I mean? So you try to keep it positive, teach them good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and, you know, different things of that nature. Tell me about your kids. I have a four and a half year old son, I have a seven year old daughter, and I also have a 23 year old. Oh. Yeah, I'm about to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with the boy. She has three little girls, so I have three grandkids and one on the way, which is the boy this time. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a child? The hardest thing is, well right now I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself, you know. And they can be expensive at times, you know, and it depends on the person's situation, you know, whether they have help or a job, you know, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard, you know, but you, I try to, you know, keep a job, you know, keep food in the house, you know, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can. Yeah. I see what you mean. What's one of your most memorable experiences? With my kids or just period? Whatever comes to mind. What's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, it's kind of like even though I'm the baby of ten kids, you know, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well pretty much my whole family have decent jobs, but I'm the one with the degree. So I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like, you know, you know, I just, that's That's the only thing I remember in graduating, you know, and my family there to support me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment? Happy that I accomplished something. You know, just even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. And I had, I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. went back. I got distracted and, you know, I was working at the same time, but I was just like more so I needed income than schooling at that time because I was a young parent, you know, because I had my daughter at 17, so I was like I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I feel like I take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder, so that's why I'm starting my class next week. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, in that I probably would have stayed in school, you know, not I let the accident just distract me and not, I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early, you know. Rather, I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things, keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus, you know, in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves, you know, through education, maybe to promote within your company or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, you know, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, you know, Like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going. You know, I want to better myself career-wise. Yeah. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Yes. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? My oldest daughter. we had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through and um I had told her that she just needs to make some changes to better her situation and um we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear it you know, hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or, or they just, you know, quote, they just don't want to hear it. You know, they may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got into an argument about it, but that just happened, you know. I just told her my... How close are you to them? I'm sorry? How close are you to them? Very close. Very close. It's just that the situation my daughter's in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. And I've been telling her. She's kind of like stubborn in her own way. You know, I was raised to listen to your mom. You know, your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong. And I've been telling her over the years, you know, different things. And it's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite. And now she's, she regretting it, you know, because she's like, my mom told me this, you know, why am I doing the opposite? So I guess she got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't told you, I didn't left it alone. And now it's up to you to make the change. How hard is that? It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. And I'm like, it seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court, you know? I only can do so much. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like train them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because, you know, they got to go to school. And I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like, it kind of like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rest it what type of person you gonna be that day you know because everybody has their days you know whether they're good or bad but this is part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know pretty much you know I need my rest because I'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job itself is very stressful so I feel like if I'm rested it'll help me. What am I like? Irritated, tired, lazy you know feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep get the rest that I need but. I never thought about that. I just, you know, because like I said, you know, everybody had their moments, they do. I never thought about that. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Okay. How would your best friend describe you?

I want to see my mom. How close are you to them? Very close. We talk every day. That's so good to hear. How close are you to your family? Very close. Even though I don't live with them, I try to see them as much as I can. How do you like your living situation? It's okay. It's cool. It's okay. It's cool. It's fine. Do you have roommates? Yes, I do. Tell me more about that. They're friendly, it's just that they're very quiet. So I'm not used to that environment. Oh. What's it like for you living with them? It's fine. How much it costs is very cheap, so that's good. And they're friendly, so it's fine. I just wish it was a little bit, it could have been better. So, yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yes. Could you say a little more about it? I had a different option to live with somebody else. and I'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with. So I kind of regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who I was supposed to move in with in the beginning. But I'm stuck for a year, so it's whatever. That's fine. How do you know them? How do I know who? Yeah. What are some things that make you really mad? There's something that really gets me really mad that I can think of off the top of my head. What ever comes to your mind? Um, whatever comes to your mind. Um, maybe when it comes to schools, how they treat the children, especially children of color, maybe. I feel like it's going to be mad. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes. Why? Because I do things from within, I guess. I'm internally motivated to do things, I guess. Yeah. Do you feel that way often? Yeah. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? with someone and what was it about? Wow. I hardly ever argue with somebody. Really? Yeah. Oh, my sister, I guess. My sister. That was about a month ago. How did you feel in that moment? I felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because I'm an adult. So, yeah, I was not feeling the situation at all. Can you tell me about that? Just her getting into grown folks' business, and it was a conversation between me and my mother, and I guess she overheard what was being said, and she felt like through my actions that I was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case. But because she didn't know the whole situation, she just automatically assumed and put stuff on Facebook about me, disrespecting me, calling me out my name. And it was, yeah, so. And she didn't come to me about it. Like, she just did all this other stuff on Facebook. I don't, that's one thing I don't like either is when you, I hate indirect comments. Like, if you need to talk to me, come directly to me. Don't put it on Facebook, tell other people. That's a pet peeve of mine. I really don't like that. Yeah, that's sound. Yeah. So, but I mean, we're fine now. So, that's good. That's so good to hear. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To not believe people so easily. So gullible, to not be so gullible. Okay. Tell me more about that. I guess I've been hearing that lately how I believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it. So I guess you could say I made a lot of mistakes. I don't want to say I regretted it because I'm glad I went through it while I was younger than me noting and going through the same situation. situations. So, um, yeah. I believe people too easily. And I give people too many chances. So, yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When I went on a cruise, which was a happy experience. When I went on a cruise to Mexico with my family, um, when I was 16, about six years ago. Wow. Yeah. That's a long time. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess so. Do you travel a lot? No. I really want to though. What do you enjoy about traveling? Um, trying new things, seeing new views of the world, um, trying the different types seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there I guess. I'd love to hear about your trips. Yeah, I plan to go to the Bahamas next year. I plan to do a lot of traveling last year actually. Really? Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty good. Somewhat. I'm tired. And I kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot. Yeah. This is my fault, though. Probably today. Yeah. Why? Well, I fell asleep late, so it's my fault. Okay. Do you feel down? No, I feel pretty happy right now. That's good. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you ever served in the military? No. Okay. No. No. Very friendly and funny. Talkative. How do you know them? Through high school. How close are you to them? We're pretty close. We try to talk as often as possible, maybe once a week. I try to see them at least every few months. That's good. When do you think it's in these kids? They're everywhere. Yeah, no comment off of that. They're more smarter. They are learning more stuff than what we learned back in the day. They are learning. They're very progressing. But when it comes to technology, they're not outside. They're always on the computer, on their phones. They don't play outside no more. They don't care about nature or about the little things in life. They just, yeah. But when it comes to their mentality, they are getting smarter because the schools are getting better. I ain't going to lie. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? What happened? Let's come back to that later. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Um, last weekend, I guess. I'd love to hear all about it. Right now? Um, what did I do? Being around my boyfriend makes me really happy. So I was just hanging out with him last weekend, and I never really get to see him that much. So, yeah. Oh, why? Because he works, I have school, different schedules. That sounds really hard. It's not that bad. How do you know them? He's my boyfriend. I've been knowing him for about, what, six months now. We met through a mutual friend in L.A., I guess. Awesome. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. That's not supposed to happen? No. How long was it? The whole time. But I was able to talk to her. Okay, good. I'm so sorry. It's fine. Was she moving around and stuff? No, she just wanted to stay right there. so okay sorry i wasn't sure if that was part of it or not okay",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/304_P/304_AUDIO.wav,0
305,28,1," Okay, looks good. So if we can just move around a little bit to activate the connect until we see a green skeleton looking thing up there. Just move around. There it goes. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and start up the virtual human that you'll be talking to. When it's over, will you just go ahead and ring this bell so I know that it's done? Okay. Will it let me know that I'm done? Yes. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm doing alright. That's good. Where are you from originally? Originally I'm from California. Born in Glendale. Nice. How do you like your living situation? I'm not too happy with it. Why? I'm just unemployed at the moment, but actually seeking, doing what I'm supposed to be doing. doing. There's some prospects there but hopefully I'll learn something today. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Do you have roommates? Yeah. What is it like for you living with them? Well I have one as a girlfriend so I consider a roommate a lover type thing. Oh. How close are you to them? Pardon me? How close are you to them? Um, we're pretty close. How do you know them? I met her last year and we've been through some troubling times but we're starting to see a light at the end of it all. That's good. Tell me more about that. Tell me more about that. The troubling times? Yes. Let me see. Well, I had gotten a DUI last year and lost my job. I'm a truck driver by trade, so that kind of threw me way off. having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job and then going to nothing kind of like plus losing my my license kind of really threw me off and I couldn't I haven't really found anything that I was interested in so I started cooking and or trying to see which other the route I can go as far as having some kind of a career and so I'm choosing to go into the culinary field but you know meanwhile I still have to work it's hard to find work without going to school and so but I think today I applied at Rouse so hopefully I'll get that I should have that job actually so but I'm I'm starting to see a light, like I said, at the end of that tunnel now, a little by little. That's good. What's your dream job? My dream job would be probably forestry service. Out in the wilderness. How did you decide to do that? Pardon me? How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, I have a lot of love for animals. I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and so and I like being, I don't like people too much, so being outdoors and I've always enjoyed being outdoors. That's how I like being a truck driver. I've traveled the world. I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or in an office. I'm more of a outdoors type of guy, so. Yeah. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips would be, I spent a year and a half in Japan and on the lower island there that they built that bridge, the largest bridge in the world. world and I went there to work for for an all-white, an all-white Tiger Act and working for Japanese circuits. So it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of Americans but that was one of the islands also that we that they bombed. So there was a lot of negativity but I I really have a good outlook on life, especially during those times. I enjoyed myself, all the traveling and meeting new people and eating different, diverse foods. It was a good experience for me. All that whole experience was pretty good for me. Traveling around with circuses and it's been great. Nice. What are some things you really like about LA? Probably One of the things I like about LA, there's not a lot that I like about LA but I Like Hollywood. I like the the movie industry The huge different different people, different different ethnics of people here. You know I enjoy talking to you know a lot of foreigners. You know I'd like to see where where it came from and what it's like there. Yeah. Traffic's ferocious. Yeah. What are some things that make you really mad? Traffic. Ignorance. Being disrespectful or whatever, you know, other people being disrespectful towards you or other people. Um, that's about it. Okay. When was the last time that happened? Pardon me? When was the last time that happened? It happens on a daily basis. It seems like, you know, I ride the bus a lot, so, you know, or if I'm riding my bike, people tend to almost run me over, so I'm not totally paying attention to traffic. You know, I find myself sometimes, you know, having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of I having to ride away or stuff like that. That sucks. Yeah, big time. What do you do when you're annoyed? What do I do when I'm annoyed? Um, probably sit there and vent, you know, speak my mind even though a lot of times it's by myself, you know, just like, you know, assholes or whatever, you know. Wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can, you know, it happens so much where I just, it just amazes me what people will do sometimes. you know, you almost get run over. I probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis. If I wouldn't pay attention, I'd be up shit creek. Yeah. How hard is that? It's hard with dealing with people, especially trying not to react because there's consequences to your reactions. Yeah. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? It was with my girlfriend And it was about being honest. I'm pretty honest with, I'm open and honest about anything and everything. And what it was about was just her lying to me, telling me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something in that aspect. And I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie. So, and I just, you know, didn't like that at all. Yeah. How did you feel in that moment? Pardon? How did you feel in that moment? Uh, let me say the word for it. Just that I don't know now that whether I can believe anything she said. So it was, I felt hurt, you know, that we'd been in a relationship for a little bit and that's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest. I don't, like I said, I don't hold back. I'm pretty honest with anything and everything that I do or say, so, you know. And if you're lying about something, well, you just, you're always having to cover up moralized with the lies that you already told and I just don't see any you know so it kind of took a lot from me trusting her now you know or whatever now I'm like you know is it truthful is it not no so it's kind of hurt our relationship I'm sorry to hear that it doesn't bother me what are some things you like to do for fun Fun? I like going to the beach. I love shooting darts but haven't done it in a while. I love the paint. I got into watercolor painting and pretty gifted at that. And I want to try some other mediums and let me see I love fishing haven't gone in a while though and I like driving truck you know it's you know my job you know I wasn't I really really enjoyed it I don't like driving through cities but usually when I'm in the middle of the night where I can see all the stars I like stargazing see if I can pick out some of those astronomy start up there and I'm a pretty easygoing guy so shooting pool sunshine just what I like. That's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Most memorable experiences Good or bad? Whatever comes to your mind. Most memorable experiences. Probably playing with lions and tigers. wrestling a baby elephant in a mud puddle. Oh my gosh. Just enjoying myself. Awesome. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Not. I don't have much family as it is. At least here in the States I don't. My mom's from Central America, so, but I'm not close to, I have three brothers, one sister, and I'm probably not really, really close to none of my siblings. I speak with one brother quite a bit. My other youngest brother, I'd just rather not, I converse with him, but I try to keep it on a professional basis. My sister I don't talk to at all. My other brother underneath me, I haven't spoken to him in years. So I'm just close with my mom, my niece, some of my nephews, and that's about it. Okay. Have you done anything to avoid it? Have I done anything to avoid it? Yes. Um, to avoid them? Yes. Uh, yeah, I just don't talk to them. I don't call them. I don't ask about them. I, you know, I talk to my mom quite a bit, my brother quite a bit, but I just don't bring up those subjects, or if they are brought up, usually say you know that's on them and I really don't want nothing to do with them so. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um You know, it depends on my thought process at the time. Like I said, I've been looking for work quite a bit. So just wondering why I don't get called. I just have racing thoughts. So, or I get depressed, you know, or I worry about things that, you know, that really I have no control over. so you know lately I just been sleeping a little bit too much at least for me because I'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a night to and now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and I'm still tired. Do you feel that way often? Lately I have been, probably about the last few months. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, tired? I, you know, I don't stay close to anybody. I just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me. So, you know, I'm more of a guy, you know, I love to work. And if I'm not, then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head. And so, you know, if I'm busy, if I'm doing what I, you know, whatever job I do, I kind of, you know, get into it, I enjoy it. It's something new for me. And so I can think about, you know, either work or I can go home and then think about this, you know, I don't have to worry about, you know, money. You know, bills getting paid and I can just concentrate on other things, either, you know, doing the things I like or, you know, maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or, you know, so stuff like that. How do you cope with them? How I what? How do you cope with them? How do I cope with them? I just try not to think about it. It's not about whether I'm coping with it or not. I just do. I'm a horrible guy. It may take me a moment to say that I'm coping with something, but if I have no control over it, there's nothing that I can really do about it. The only thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing, and that's actively looking for work, actively going out on interviews, talking with others about work so I can just kind of, you know, get back to basics. You know, I just don't let a lot of stuff bother me. It does bother me, but I try not to let it continue bothering me. Yeah. Has that gotten you in trouble? if what else got me in trouble? My moods? I mean, yeah, money, I mean, you know, my past, I got a past history, so, which kind of tends to bother my hiring process. I don't know if I'm going to get hired, so I've got to deal with different types of employers who are, say, felony friendly and stuff like that. And I've taken classes on how to interview, how to answer some of the questions, which come up quite a bit. And I kind of reflect back on that, but I just, I got to keep putting into my head that that's not who I want to be anymore. So or, you know, I've done, I've done, I've done my time, so to say, but I took the time, You know, the last time I just took a lot of time and tried to work on the issues that were bothering me. So, you know, towards positive stuff, I got my GEDs and different things, took a lot of classes, thought about going to school, looking to go into school. But anything that would kind of change my old ways and try to move on to more productive activities. That's good. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Pardon? Do you feel like therapy is useful? I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I still didn't hear you. I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I still didn't hear you. I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I still didn't hear you. Do you feel like therapy is useful? That people have been deceitful? Can you repeat that one more time? I'll talk about that later. All right. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I've been diagnosed with bipolarism. How hard is that? It's tough if you don't, you know, I don't medicate so, I mean I have been on medications before in the past, but I guess I try to live life on life's terms. And I just, you know, I know the medical staff always want to label something and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills. I've been on probably every magical pill that there is for that. And some of them have been too strong or some of them are not strong enough. So I just try to cope with things with just my life skills. I don't want to be using drugs. Drugs, I know certain drugs work for like three to four months, six months, and then they go, well here, I'm gonna try you on this, or I'm gonna try you on that, and it's just an ongoing process, and I probably for about the last two years, actually about three years, I kind of just said, you know what, that's it. Whether it's different than whether if I would be on meds for it, I don't think so. It's still the same stuff. I still get the same problems and I still get the same anxieties as if I was on medication for it or not. So I just deal with it. Sometimes it's not good. I get irritated at people a lot. I don't like people. I don't like crowds. I don't like obnoxious people. and you're gonna be quiet so but I got a person you know it's not to that personality but I think people can see me and just say don't mess with this guy or you know but still you know I like I ride public transportation quite a bit and you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes I I gotta get off the bus. That's how I'll deal with people. Because I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. So I just let it go. I'd rather take the time on getting off the bus, waiting for the next bus, and hopefully it's not that bad. I understand. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Did I have a problem before I got out? Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Well, I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out. The thing is, I know other people, I have a lot of ups and downs. So I know a lot of, in my younger days, people would tell me, you know, when I told them that I was diagnosed with bipolar, that a lot of remarks were like, oh, that's what was wrong with you. We wish that you would have found that out years ago. And like I said, I don't think the meds really work, but what I do, I think time kind of, you just getting older kind of, you know, makes it work, you know, me dealing with life, so. How has seeing a therapist affected you? Pardon me? How has seeing a therapist affected you? I talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently and it helps a lot you know just to get out my anger my thoughts a lot of people other people may not understand that but a therapist is I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out, whatever's bothering me, whether it be people, you know, other issues, you know, whatever the case may be, I just think talking about it, and there's such good listeners and can kind of like, you know, they give me the same advice that, you know, that I, you know, give myself or whatever that I would give to others, but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else, somebody who supposedly has, you know, are, you know, they go to school for this. But it's good to be here. That's so good to hear. Yeah. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, I don't go anymore. So I kind of miss it, you know, like I said, I miss it a lot actually, but it's just one of those things, I just deal with it accordingly. If I ever get a chance to go through therapy again, I probably will. Why did you stop? Well, monetary reasons. I don't have health insurance. There's a lot of things that I'd like to do, but I can't. Money situation is not that great right now. I'm sorry. How do your friends describe you? How does my friends describe me? Yeah. They would probably describe me as an energetic, outgoing person. I get to know people, laugh, I laugh a lot, but it would probably tell you that I'm also a very serious and a hidden person. I don't reveal a lot, you know? And so. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Someone who has been a positive influence in my life? Yeah. Someone who's been, What's the most positive thing in your life? Probably my boss. One of my bosses when I first started with exotic animals. He was real, you know, he was German and they didn't teach, I don't know what he saw in me, but He taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and showed a lot of confidence in me and also built confidence in myself. And sort of let me know that there's nothing that I really can't accomplish if I put my mind to it. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Okay, are we all done? I think so. She said goodbye. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and shut this down and take your mic off. and take your mic off and then we just have a quick post for you to",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/305_P/305_AUDIO.wav,1
306,21,1," Okay, looks like we're good. But let's move around a little bit. Make sure that the connect is picking you up. Okay. All right, it's taking its time. Okay, great. And then if you don't mind, can I ask you to just place yourself on the floor? Yeah. Perfect. We just can't have anything in your hands. Okay, great. Okay, and when this is all done, she'll let you know. And then if you want to hit this doorbell again to let me know. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? Colorado. Really? Mm-hmm. Why'd you move to LA? Career. Career possibilities. Hmm. What do you do now? Paralegal. Awesome. When'd you move to LA? For further education, for the weather, for a friend. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not often at all now. Every few years. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather, the beach, sunsets at the beach, a lot of career possibilities, educated group of people, sophisticated market. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It is an adjustment to come here. A lot of people misjudge it a little bit. It's a laid back, appearing town, but it's actually very sensitive to success and commercialization and that kind of thing. So you have to keep up the pace. How hard is that? It's a little bit harder, I think, when you first make the adjustment, and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you do in others. That makes sense. What's your dream job? Oh, an attorney. Really? Why? Oh, just because you have the power, you can use skills to be able to affect people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being an assistant in that field. Cool. How close are you to your family? Oh, a lot of it is not around anymore. I just have brothers and sisters out of state, so not particularly close right now. I'm sorry. What are some things that make you really mad? Dishonesty, unkindness, lack of sympathy, insensitivity. How are you at controlling your temper? Very good. If anything, I'm regressive that way. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Oh, wow. Oh, just a friend. A friend who is right now has a fabulous job but is spending too much money that he needs to save. Uh-oh. How do you know them? Through a work situation, just a work connection. How close are you to them? Close now. We spend time. We go out and have fun sometimes. That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? walk, walk in the beach, you know, shop in the beach areas. It's kind of a rodeo drive occasionally and see films, art galleries. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Oh, my daughter. Ah. Tell me about your kids. I just have one daughter who graduated UCLA Law School and I raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was worth it, the two jobs and the work. What's the best thing about being a parent? Just, I'd say peer pressure. It can totally alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child. It's good. Yeah. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, wow. Yeah, my daughter, for being now at a graduate law school when she was, we kept her in Beverly Hills schools. And some of those very wealthy kids with very named celebrity families used to like shoplift. She actually got in trouble for that once, and that because she was influenced. So that was a really bad time for us. That sounds really hard. What do you think of today's kids? I think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in. I think they're a little misguided, I think a little uninspired right now. I think they've been weighed down by the concerns of the wars and things like that. And I think they could probably use a common goal, a common, you know, anality, as opposed to just being more separated group than once they were, I think. You know, kind of uninspired right now. Yeah, I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I worry sometimes about work issues, but it's pretty easy. Do you feel that way often? No, I don't feel like I'm not sleeping. I just occasionally worry about something at work. When was the last time that happened? Oh gosh, about a couple weeks ago. How did you feel in that moment? Just, you know, unfortunate we have to worry, you know, unfortunate this isn't easier. It's just cooperation between people. It solves most everything, you know, so you always want to have that around you. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just stressed. Yeah, stressed. More stressed. That sounds really hard. Do you feel down? Yeah, fatigue has a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more rested. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not depression. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Probably that was considered the possibility. I had an employment lawsuit several years ago and actually litigated it and won a settlement. It's something about a whistleblower thing, implications of that, and I was kind of harassed about it. And so I found when I got out of it, I couldn't find work right away in my field, so I had to go into a different field, go back to UCLA and get a new professional direction. And I found myself fearful sometimes that it's going to happen again, you know, anything that would happen again. Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. What got you to seek help? Just that I was noticing that. I was noticing that I was feeling very, in my paralegal class I had a section about employment law. And there was a very complicated filing I had done with great adult work and study for my case. But once faced with it again in that class setting, I just couldn't get it done. It was late, it was a late paper for me. And I realized I was traumatized by having to go through that again. Post-traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down, from what I understand. So I think it was just hitting me later, that I was having to face that paper again, and wow. No adrenaline, just like wow, there it is again. What were your symptoms? Just extreme avoidance of getting something done that should have been easy for me, and thinking about it as thoroughly as I should have, or studying it, or putting it off. the feeling of going through that paper, that type of paper, even if it's just a class assignment again. Yeah. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Well, not lately. You know, back then for sure when that happened, which was about 10 years ago now, it was settled in court about seven years ago now, and yeah, it was effective. You know, it was effective in the way you view most everything and your confidence and that kind of thing. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I'm sorry, repeat the question? Do you feel like they're peaceful? Peaceful, do I feel peaceful? Well, yeah, I was peaceful that it was settled, but angry that it ever happened. So it's hard to all probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue, ever. It always, the mention of it always makes me angry that I had to go through that. Yeah. Yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? I don't think so. I tried everything to avoid it, you know. And so I think that was aggravating for me too because I'm a patient person, I'm realistic. And I tried everything to avoid confrontation in the matter, but it was just required to try to help me cover the damage to our lives and my daughter's life. Yeah. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Not now. Maybe one time in my life, not now. If you can't communicate, you know, if you can communicate, you can overcome people's perceptions and their judgments of you. If you can effectively explain something, it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have, judgments for age or anything like that. Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Well, just raising a daughter, extendedly, you know, or, you know, just the experience of thinking that was a, after all the years, that was a success for graduating from law school. Yeah. How did you feel in that moment? Just like a lot of work had a good ending. you know, happy, glad that it was fulfilled, wishes or dreams for this child were fulfilled, you know, and she was able to make that success. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Wow. I tend to be kind of happy with life because the alternative is going to harm your ability to succeed. So I try to force happiness, I guess, in most every situation in my life. I find something about it. When I lost some weight recently, that made me really happy. Wow, that's great. Do you travel a lot? I travel a little bit locally. I traveled more when I was younger. I really enjoy that, but I've just been too busy in the last few years. Yeah. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just new places, ability to take the worries we have every day, work or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. We went back to Colorado several years ago, went through Vail, and spent the night there. And it was just during spring, there weren't many skiers, and it was just beautiful and very quiet. A lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains, and it was beautiful. That sounds like a great situation. How would your best friend describe you? Wow, just ardent, hardworking, loyal, creative. Okay. What's the best thing about being a parent? Just seeing something that you're creating, you're trying to create, become something that you hoped the picture would be. that's the case. You know, it's just hard work that's fulfilled or presented itself in a certain way that, you know, it makes you happy. Yeah. How close are you to them? To my daughter? Um, pretty close. She just had a baby. She's in the Bay Area. She sends me pictures all the time. Aw. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me, okay? Goodbye. Bye. Those are so cool. Yeah? Okay, cool. Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and shut the recording down.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/306_P/306_AUDIO.wav,1
307,23,1," looking at you all right okay so now let's make sure the Xbox connect is picking you up we'll just move around we have to wait till this guy pops up as like a little green skeleton it's going it's going there we go perfect okay and then I'll start this recording as well okay when this is done she'll let you know and you can just hit the doorbell to let me know. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Where are you from originally? Um, Moscow. Really? Why did you move to LA? My family moved to the US and then I moved down here eventually for college. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It took a long time to, I've been living here for about a year since I graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs. but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though. That's good. How do you like your living situation? It goes off and on. I have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months I think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality TV show for a while. Yeah. How do you know them? One's from college, and the other one we found on Craigslist. How close are you to them? It varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other. So I guess pretty close. Right now we're kind of distant. Aw. Tell me more about that. Oh, about the distance? Yes. Okay. Well, we haven't seen each other, we haven't hung out in like two weeks, because one of them got into like this car accident, and so she's been distant since then and kind of locks herself up in her room. And the other one is always working late, so we just, our scheduling has been off, and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone, so it's just kind of, we're just waiting for someone, I guess, to make the first move. Yeah, that sucks. It's okay, it'll get better. Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? It depends with whom I'm dealing with, I guess I would say. With some people, I guess with my family, it's not very good. My boyfriend, it's not very good. But with other people that I might not know so well, then I'm able to control it a little bit more, but a little bit more passive-aggressive rather than full-on anger. Why? Oh, because I don't want them to see me as a bitch. That makes sense. Yeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my best friend, Nicole. She's probably been, she's been, we've been best friends for like, God, since high school, freshman year of high school is when we first met. So a long time. So yeah. Can you give me an example of that? Of, of what? How do you know them? My friend, Nicole. Yeah. We met in French class freshman year of high school. We were in the same class and then we kind of started doing homework together. And we had a lot of classes, the same classes together. And so we just kind of started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then. Nice. Mm-hmm. What are some things you like to do for fun? Um, going out with friends, going to the bars, going dancing, biking, hiking, staying active, going to the movies, going out to the restaurants, photography, just hanging out with friends I guess, whatever. Okay. How close are you to your family? And it varies. Like, I'm really close to them when it comes to things about, like, school, work, those kinds of things. But when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal, personal things, I don't really discuss that with them. So I guess superficially close. But I rely on them a lot, so we're close, I guess. That's good. What are some things that make you really mad? That's a good question. I guess it depends who it is again. I guess people who are inconsiderate, unthoughtful, flaky, ignorant, and yeah, I guess those kinds of people. And then people just, what makes me mad is a good question. I guess a lot of things make me mad. But it's mostly how people react to different situations can make me angry, I guess. Yeah. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Oh, yesterday. And it was my boyfriend. and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and work out and save money. And so by doing that, what he does is he orders pizza in, so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy. And so I got frustrated with him because I'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy, and then each time he's like, I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it, and then he doesn't. So he's constantly breaking promises. That's another thing that makes me angry is people who don't follow through. Yeah. Do you feel that way often? about other people or about myself or angry? whatever comes to your mind. I don't have a cop out. Um... Angry? I guess we'll go with that. No, I don't feel angry often. Okay. What's your dream job? Dang it. That is a tough one. How about just getting paid to be me? Um... I don't know. That's kind of what I'm trying to figure out right now. job because I hated it. It was mostly sitting in an office all day, which I thought was extremely boring. So now I work in a restaurant job and I'm trying to look for a second job to support myself. My dream job, I don't know what it would be, but I know it would involve people and I'd love to have some kind of finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end. I guess that's something I realized I like to see the result from all my hard I majored in sociology and as much as I loved that major, you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution. So it's just like at the end, it's all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes. So something to do with people, maybe something artistic. I love photography. I love cooking, baking in particular. So, I don't know, something in that realm, I guess. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I used to travel a lot. My family is known for traveling. We've gone to, gosh, seven, eight different countries. I've lived in three or four different countries. Wow. I haven't traveled a lot lately just because I have no money, and jobs kind of tie you down. But I would love to have that. I guess my dream job would be a photographer for National Geographic. That would be awesome. Yeah. Or a food photographer that travels. That would be awesome, too. But anyways, yeah, I do travel a lot. What do you enjoy about traveling? The new places, new faces, new experiences. I get restless very easily, so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine. I hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life, so it's nice to throw things up. I see what you mean. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, gosh. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to think. What are my trips? I guess we can talk about, I don't know, it's funny, even though I've been to lots of different countries, one of my most memorable trips, one of the trips I took with my family was a three-week road trip with my family. There's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon. Oh, my gosh. I know. Needless to say, it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping, you start getting on each other's nerves. But it was really fun. And then even though I've traveled so many places, I realized that there's such a beauty in the American landscape. And so we were all around the Southwest, from the Grand Canyon to Zion to the Grand Tetons to Yellowstone. And it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty. So we saw grizzly bear, black bear, lots of bison, a wolf. It was really cool. Those kinds of, I don't know, natural wonders also really amaze me because those things aren't man-made. And as pretentious as it sounds, after a while, Europe kind of gets, not old, but it's like, you know, you get the same idea, like, white, old white men building great buildings and artwork, and it's beautiful and all, but, like, you just kind of, like, okay, I want to see something that's, like, natural and beautiful, or something that's different, too. Yeah. I see what you mean. Cool. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Um, pretty easy as long as I get to, well I always sleep, so easy. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Oh, grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy, don't say much, I'm just kind of off in my own world. Do you feel that way often? Not anymore. I usually get enough sleep and I've been working out more so it's kind of Energizing me, but no it's not too bad That's good Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I guess I've just been more negative, but it has to do with life circumstances kind of like Uh, it's been about almost five months since I quit my full-time job job, haven't found anything else, haven't really found anything else I'm interested in. So it's more just like, oh, what am I doing, da-da-da, that kind of thing. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yeah. It is hard. And it's like I'm very picky because I don't want to just sit in my own cubicle because I quit my job exactly for that reason. So why go back to another job just to do the same exact thing that I quit my other job for? So it's like I have to make it worthwhile that I quit my last job to get a better job So it's kind of like stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck Barely making it just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when did I give up and and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles. I don't know. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is hard, but I mean, I guess everyone goes to that same situation after college, so, but I guess it's tough because a lot of my friends, because I went to a pretty good school, and you know, I have a friend who's teaching English in Afghanistan, another one who's met the president, you know, and one that's doing Teach for America, another friend who's in Harvard School, like Harvard, you know, getting her master's. So it's kind of like, ah, all that comparison. And then here I am working at a little restaurant job, so. Yeah. Do you feel down? I do sometimes, yes. But I'm going to Hawaii next week, so right now I'm fine. Nice. Yes. But, yeah, usually it's been kind of like down because I'm just trying to find, like, what I'm supposed to, you know, like what do I want to do next and like money situations are just very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like I can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's all good. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Uh, no, I don't think so, but I mean, I think everyone goes through depression here and there, so I don't know if you can, but not like medically diagnosed. I'm not on meds. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you ever served in the military? Nope. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Oh, to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail. Because I'm one of those people, if I'm not going to be the best at something, then I'm just not going to try. I accept the best or nothing at all. Go big or go home. But I think I would have told my high school self to go and try lots of things even if it means I'm not going to be the best at it. So, 10 years ago. Well, that would have made me like 12, so. I used to do a lot of things. I used to act. I think I would have continued doing that. I used to write a lot when I was younger. I used to write miniature, like little stories, short stories from my parents all the time. And I kind of stopped doing those things because I was like, oh, I'm not good at it, so I'm not going to do it. And I think that I just continued doing those things. I've tried, you know, different classes. I don't know, different sports. I kind of just stuck with soccer growing up. I don't know, I just expand myself more rather than, like, find something I'm good at and just stay with it, but never really try harder. Kind of just like a stay. I always kind of say that one level of us, once I'm good, I just stay for good. I don't try to go above that. If that makes any sense. Yeah. What do you do to relax? I don't know. Right now it's super lame, but I watch TV. But I used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake. But now it's just like since I'm on my feet all day and constantly interacting with people, I just kind of want to unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and be like, I'm done. Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? That's a tough question. Probably the day I got accepted into Pomona College. I was a freshman at Wellesley College, which is a women's college back east. And I hated it from like the second, from like the first week. I just knew that I chose the wrong college. And I was like miserable for the entire year. And I only applied to one school to transfer at Pomona College, like that's out in Claremont. And I didn't think I was going to get in. And I was, because it was like a 4% acceptance rate, and I was like, what are the chances? Like, this is ridiculous. I don't think I'm going to get in. And I was like, you know, the thought of going back to Wall State was super depressing. But then I got an email from one of the admissions counselors that I had met when I was visiting Pomona. And he was like, hi, Tatiana. Like, just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about Pomona, hope all is well. And I was like, why would you be emailing me the day we find out if we got accepted or not? Unless I got the acceptance. And so sure enough, a couple hours later, I got the email that I was accepted into Pomona and that was like the best day of my life. I was so happy. That's really great. Yeah, it was awesome. So then I took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and I went and bought myself some new dresses, went crazy, dyed my hair, pierced my nails. I was like, let's start this whole thing over. It was cool. Awesome. Yeah. How would your best friend describe you? bubbly fun maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um probably uh definitely friendly um and pretty like a positive person um but sometimes maybe a little bit aggressive. But for the most part I think positive things. I mean, she's my best friend, so... Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Hmm... really happy. Oh, when I was in Mexico over winter, well, no, I don't know. My boyfriend took me on this sailing trip down in San Clemente, and that was really fun. And we just, like, went sailing, and then walked around the missions, hung out on the beach. That was really fun. That was a good time. That was a great situation. Yeah, it was cool. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye. I'm gonna share it. I don't know where to put the thing. Hi. Hello. So I'm going to go ahead and shut the recording down and then we just have a quick post survey. Alright. And then I can tell you a little bit more about what we just participated in.

I meditate. and I skateboard. Oh, I can meditate on my board. Could you say a little more about that? I meditate, it helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate, nice two hour skate and just relax. That sounds like a great situation. How hard is that? It's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. I actually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA, streets in LA. The beaches is always good. Nice. Just, uh, it's really not that hard at all. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? The situation with my life right now, I can't find a fucking job. It can be tough to find a good job these days. I don't even care about a good job, I just need a job. Anything that pays. Just gets, just gets hard after a while. Yeah. Can you tell me about that? I mean, I applied from anywhere and everywhere. from entry level to management to anywhere in between and I can't find a job. I can't get a job. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying.

It isn't. Do you do it that way often? Yes, that happens often. When was the last time that happened? Last night I couldn't sleep. Why? Just thinking about my situation.

Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? About three years ago, four years ago, a couple years ago. What got you to seek help? My mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed and lack of energy, always wanting to sleep, lack lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know. I don't have health insurance. Um... I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone. Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Oh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life. What were your symptoms? Lack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable, either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yes. Can you give me an example of that? My sister just passed away. I'm sorry to hear that. It's all right. Six months ago. And I became homeless and jobless two weeks ago. And I got to a point where I just missed her and I wanted to be with her. Yeah. How close are you to your family? pretty dysfunctional family. You know, really can't depend on them. That's why I just depend on myself. So... That sounds really hard. It is what it is. What are you going to do? Yeah. I'd like to give up, but... I'd like to give up, but my parents just buried their daughter six months ago. They don't want to bury their other daughter. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know. I don't know. I just haven't had good luck. I was a corporate manager for 20 years. And who would have known 20 years ago what advice I would have given myself because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Because I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy? A couple days ago this week. I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things sprouting. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me, but I need like two more weeks here in LA so I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. I was happy because I was getting callbacks and things were starting to look up for me, But it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road and I'm taking off and I'm leaving L.A. How would your best friend describe you? Loyal, emotional. Strong. Do you consider yourself an introvert? I have been lately. I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert and I stay to myself. What made you decide to do that? Circumstances in my life I don't feel as confident. I don't feel as charming and as social. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I don't know. It's hard to say. I can't really answer that one. Okay. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Oh shit.

We're going to chat with her for a bit. And I'm going to give you the doorbell again. You guys are done talking when she says goodbye to you. If you just want to hit the store bell, I'll come back over. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ali. Thanks for coming.

Well, I rap and produce hip-hop. I play video games and then hang out with people. Awesome. Do you have any friends? No. Okay. How are you at breaking things? Not very good at breaking things. on the way over here my mom and how to get here the beach uh no the last place i went was los cabos no not los cabos uh fuck where'd i go somewhere in mexico no no yes like four years ago right now no lately not very easy no just lately uh Well, my wife left like three weeks ago and after that I haven't been able to sleep I'm not just burying my head and stuff. I don't know how to do stuff I try to keep my mind off of it like do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything I don't have I never went to therapy wait no I did go to therapy like three four years ago because I went to a separate therapist but then I went to a a thing where they they did a bunch of uh cognitive tests and memory tests and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time like i get depressed and it lasts for months on end yeah uh to be honest i don't know i think it's more about like you focusing on yourself and like i don't know i don't know how to explain that it's like you have to figure out things within yourself you don't need someone else to talk to well originally when I went to therapist I was court-ordered now I want to go to therapy for my anger management though I don't know what I mean, my wife left like three weeks ago, so yes. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done, so yeah. What advice would you give yourself to help your family this time? Well considering I'm only 19, if I could go back 19 years, I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife. And not to be angry. yeah driving away my wife yes many many things every every day well i could have not broken stuff and i could have uh stopped like I was basically blocking out the external universe and I was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life I was basically escaping and so in that sense I wasn't paying attention to her and that's basically why she left I mean that and being angry is like both contributed their own proportion their own portion earlier today uh I mean, I feel really happy all the time, and then it just, like, goes away. It's, like, back and forth. Like, one day, one second I'll be really happy, and then another second I'll be really sad because I'll think about something again. It's, like, I got to keep my mind off of things and, like, move forward and, like, think. I don't really know how to explain it. It's just something you feel. No? You need better programming. Programming. silly I'm creative potential of intelligence I'm charming I'm loving at some points I'm all of those things. At some points I'm not. Doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around. My hip hop. I mean, kid travel here. You need better programming. Kid Traveler is my friend. To be a hip hop artist. I don't know, I just started one day. How hard is it? Not hard anymore. I mean, it was hard when I was practicing when I was younger. When I was like 11 or 12. Now it's just easy. It's easy.

Okay, so she's going to chat with you. And then when you're done, she'll let you know when the time is over. You can press this button. Alright. Yes, it's okay. Fine. They're in Hollywood. Seattle. How do you get to the hotel? That's kind of a vague question. Do you travel? You need to change the scenery. What do you enjoy about traveling? like traveling by train so my favorite thing uh... because i don't fly i can't stand airplanes the pre-trade what uh... flyer airplane uh... probably December of nineteen eighty six three seven that nothing that was to tell really news that is go from L.A. up to Seattle and up to Vancouver that's probably the main thing that I do take the train uh... not very often once a week five years or so uh... yes sir uh... depends on what it is that i'm annoyed by could be anything depends whether it's uh... something or someone you know if it's someone i mean i don't i don't uh... i don't get physical towards the by the night and what they've done to piss me off and i'm certainly not above uh... shouting at them for whatever reason just depends uh... in terms of lasting out of the people physically i don't do that but in order to have some questions if if the p l i'm not above you know touching a waller punching something nearby just i mean i'm not going to this was doesn't physically hurt me with that you know just get some steam that lost their lives in steam up that's normal for me face to face uh... can remember a long time argue though with people online about stupid shit. You know, that's normal shit. But as far as, like, face-to-face, you know, it's been a long time. Currently or overall? Which one? You mean someone I'm in contact with now or someone maybe from my past? Which is it? Okay, my mom had a Boyfriend when I was a teenager He was like a father figure when I was about 14 So he was a pretty positive influence Not at all What's your dream job? To open up a record shop. Yeah. Well, I'm an unemployed office worker right now. As in what? Doing what? Be more specific. going on a first date with a girlfriend back in 2007 when we first met uh just made arrangements to meet her and her daughter and her daughter's friends at the queen mary long beach and uh... you know i had spent the evening this is the day the evening together hanging out me dinner and state of the hotel yes captain of the yet wasn't uh... well that was beginning of a relationship at times though i was that's how i do it yes you're right there for the time currently yet did i don't it sucks balls a have remains sucks In some ways it's okay because they don't see me that much because I'm not really around them. Other times I need to have my own space. It's difficult for me that way. We get along, but I don't really see them that much. That's by design. I like to be alone. Sometimes I'll read, but just mainly I like to be alone. Maybe just doing nothing. It just depends. No. No. No. No. I'm sorry. Repeat that. No, not necessarily. How would you describe yourself if you were a heavy sleeper? Very. I'm a heavy sleeper. What would you call yourself if you were a heavy sleeper? I don't know if I would call it down, but I'm not necessarily what you would call... it down, but I'm not necessarily what you would call cheery, but I don't know that I'm necessarily down. Yeah, all the time. It's hard to say. I don't know. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know that I really want the one to ask. I think you probably have to ask someone else about that. I have a difficult time answering that question. What are you most proud of? Most proud of? uh... that i didn't didn't fall into drugs like a lot of other people that i know listening to music on vinyl being around dogs How many times have you been to a party? Have you been to a party? When do you think you'll be taking a break? I'm glad I don't have any. I think they're, uh, especially here in Los Angeles, I, I, they drive me nuts. I can't stand them. I assume you mean post high school I briefly just took basic I take this general studies from what I remember I actually didn't finish. I quit to go play in a band. So I skipped a lot of school, so I didn't really, you know. So nothing. It was a junior college, community college, so I didn't go to university. So I was just, do what? Stop going? I just wasn't interested. My interest was elsewhere, so I just quit going. in terms of what well sure everyone has a regret over something you know I'm not going to get specific but yeah sure there are things I regret sure 20 years ago what was that 93 Well, ten years ago... Uh... 2003... It's hard to say. It's hard to say. I've got to... Let's come back to that one, maybe. Okay. How are your best friends? Oh, I don't have a best friend these days. I think it depends on your definition of friend I don't I don't hang out with too many people I had a so called best friend but that was like 20 some odd years ago I'm very much a loner these days so I don't really have what you would consider a best or really close friend I just don't have that See ya.

So now I'm going to go ahead and start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's finished, she'll let you know.

Yes, I have a person that I hear once in a while, and I talked to them, and I had an argument about them listening on my phone. Avoidance. Whatever annoys me. Being homeless. Yes, it was. Well, they don't particularly like homeless people in LA. So it's really hard if you're homeless. Where do you live? Right now I live in an apartment. How do you like your living situation? I don't. I don't like the neighbors. Well, they harass you all the time. So I don't come out of the apartment. Well, I didn't know when I moved there that they were horrible people. I've complained to management but they don't do anything about it. They just tell me to move. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. Back in the 90s. What got you into this problem? Crying all the time. Yes, yes. I was in the hospital two months ago for 15 days. I was in there for depression for arguing with a person. That's not real. I ignore the person when I hear them. It's not hard anymore. It was before I was going to therapy. How has the experience affected you? It's helped me be more cheerful and ignore things that bother me. What were your symptoms? uh sleeping all the time eating too much uh arguing screaming at this unreal person um before i found out no Lately, I've still been pretty depressed. Yes. Very hard. Are you triggered by something? Well, I wake up about every two hours to go to the bathroom. Or some noise wakes me up. So I don't sleep well. And I'm tired all the time. Don't remember.

312,18,1," Should I move my arms around? Oh. Oh. Interesting. and if it's not it was to say don't answer that if I said I don't answer that just remember it's time remember that's all okay that's all do I push a button to start or does she start on her own okay impressive Yes. Yes. Fine, how about you? Here. Yes. The weather. The weather mainly. Yeah, the weather. Sorry. Sorry. Not the people, but some of the people. Stuff like that. Some people, yeah. Okay, I'm cutting you off. Not as much as I used to. I used to be in school, and I used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that. But I'm not in school right now. But later I'll get back into school, and I'll travel more. But right now, no doubt. I don't. I don't enjoy traveling. What do you study in physics? Are you still working in that? Are you studying now? Awesome! Professor at a place like USC or UC or LA or something like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest. You are actually pretty good at this. There's a lot of people. The first one I guess is my physics teacher and AP physics teacher in high school. Even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major, He still was a very good influence. He told me, you know, he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade, but about learning. Okay. I'm pretty good, I think. I'm single, so I don't get in many arguments. But it's probably my brother about... He's doing some things too, playing a video game together. I know I'm pretty old to play video games. Well, they're actually pretty good. It's probably something like that. And me being angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right, that's all. Barely close. I see them pretty often. I see them a couple times a week. They're getting older, so I help them with groceries and things like that. And my brother, I see the same with them. Same time. My sister, I tutor her kids, my nephews, so I see them about once a week also. Interesting. Yes. Yes. Because I spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody. That's introverted. I guess I play video games and I work out. I work out, I think, a lot. I try to at least. I roll my eyes, which has been totally is a bad thing. And... That's about it, I think. Bad parenting. Basically, parents are more self-centered, more to themselves, unlike previous generations. And the kids just do what they want because parents aren't there. Parents aren't being parents, in my personal opinion. I guess... Um... Thank you. I don't really have a best friend. Introverted, remember? I'm biased obviously but they are I'm really good in math I'm not really sure if you can't, not saying you can't get better than me in math the thing is it's just that you get a certain confidence with it no matter what it is you need to learn in math you've always figured it out I am patient I think and I am disciplined where I can spend many hours, many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so I have to do it anyway that type of thing when I a good workout doing well in video games small middle things like that when something happens with my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that puts me in a good mood thank you right now is the fact that research that I did I did make it this far research wise that's all that's all interesting um when you start off in school read about Einstein and things like that. He says general relativity and you hear about particle physics. You have no idea what it is. You know it's very complicated. Things like quantum mechanics. And you still haven't realized you're interested in that. But you're not sure if you can actually make it. And eventually each step of time goes by. As time goes on you get closer and closer. Eventually you make the goal. Eventually you realize you are just not as good as Einstein. But you are up there. You can do research in physics. You can add to man's knowledge in science. And that's impressive that you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid. Okay. Okay. A few weeks ago when I got a good grade in a class. Thank you. Yes, briefly. Many years ago. Yes. I don't know. Growing up, I always thought that was my dream when I was a kid. That's why. And I just went about doing that. I was National Guard, I think, about 18, 19. I got commissioned at 21. I was only in for about a year, so I left at 22. Yes. Not really. I don't think it did. I think it's just something I grew up already expecting to be so it didn't really change me as much. Graduate school. In physics. No. No. It depends if I work out really hard the day before. If I work out pretty hard, it's bad. But if I don't work out, I don't know. It's hard. I guess moderately. Thank you. Yes. It's okay. Okay. I'm probably like I am now. Normal, I think. not as happy about everything, but still pretty okay. I can still function. No. Maybe slightly... No. Yes. Yes, I have changes in my thoughts I'm applying to grad school again It's been a while And slightly apprehensive Happy that it looks good But apprehensive that it might not be good Things like that What do you mean by that? I know it's your computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school? Understand. Okay. I agree. No, not really. Probably keep doing what you're doing. Even though I'm not that old, believe it or not. 20 years ago, I was probably 15. No? No. Yeah, I was 15. Just keep doing what you're doing. I think I was very lucky and fortunate the way it worked out. If it was a little bit different, I don't think it would work out so well. Even though it's not perfect now, I think we're doing really well, personally. Thank you. Same here. Goodbye. I'll keep this on. Take this off now? Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/312_P/312_AUDIO.wav,0
313,44,1," Okay, so that shows you that everything is working. Oh. This is for our purposes. All right. All right. Now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And then when she finishes, I'm going to give you the doorbell so you can let me know. All right. And then if you want to push this down so these loops are over your ears. Sorry. Thanks. I'm not a therapist, but you really learn about people and you love to learn about you. I like to do some research on you. I'm a student of the University of Michigan, and I'm a student of the University of Michigan. Are you a student of the University of Michigan? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Uh, okay, I guess. Not bad, not good. So-so. Where are you from and where are you from? Denver, Colorado. Really? Why did you choose LA? To pursue job opportunities. When did you choose LA? About two years ago. How often do you go to LA? Once or twice a year. Nice! What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you don't really like about LA? How many people do you think are rude at the store? Pretty easy. That's good. What are some people that are rude? Let's say people are rude, not having enough money. What else? Just a lot of things are frustrating I guess. I guess it depends on what I'm annoyed about. Like is that another person or about something I did or just life in general. uh... if somebody like a person annoys me out probably let them know they're going to be until they stop that what you're talking about uh... so so not as good as i'd like to be few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time pretty pissed off taken advantage of I like to go to the gym, hang out with friends, read, write, that sort of thing. At times. Why? Okay. What did you study at school? Are you a student? What do you do now? sales to own several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams yes that's a job What's something that's memorable to you? Really? Tell me more about that. I was pretty young, carefree, good times. Have you traveled a lot? Not recently, but I have in my life. Traveled quite a bit. How much have you traveled on your trip? Let's see. I went to London. It was a lot of fun. Pretty cool city. A little too expensive, but definitely cool. of what just anything in life um let's see uh boy that's a good question um moving to LA was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to move here so that was memorable I would say okay maybe like six months ago How do you feel about that? Things were just going really well. Didn't have much stress in my life. Have you ever said anything that made you feel more irritated? Yeah, I'm easier, more easily irritated, and yell more, tired more, kind of down, feeling down more. Not as productive. Have you been down more than once? Yeah, a while ago. How long ago were you down? I don't know exactly. It's been a few years. But I still feel the same as I did when they diagnosed me. So I assume I'm still depressed. What's up with you? Well, I'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems. So I just thought that would be a good idea. So I did, and that's what I found out. Oh yeah, definitely. I mean, it depends on what you mean by therapy. Like, I or most people probably can't afford good therapy, but just even talking to friends, I would consider therapy. Somebody who will listen, so it helps to get stuff off your chest. Thanks. um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff like out there like out of your head or whatever it that's uh it helps to de-stress i think Pretty girls? Um... I'm a good leader. I'm really smart. Being able to survive on my own in a city like this, completely on my own with no outside help. Yeah, lots of stuff. Do you have any secrets? What advice would you give yourself to help your parents? older than me as much as possible he's always good for a sort of pep talk but with a dose of reality, he doesn't sugarcoat anything. So talking to him always helps give me perspective. Okay. How are you guys doing? Talented and, I don't know, good at stuff. I'm good at a lot of stuff. People seem to notice that, I guess. nice, good disposition, funny. See you later. Are you like controlling the person in the back?",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/313_P/313_AUDIO.wav,0
314,19,1," Don't I look gorgeous? Let me straighten up a little bit here. Okay, so I'm just going to do something that syncs our equipment. Okay, now you're going to chat with her for a bit, and then when you are done, I'm going to give you the doorbell again, and I'm going to put it right over there when she says you're done talking, if you just want to ring it to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah, so I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. uh well most recently we like two months ago we went to israel for a pilgrimage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in korazim which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh um i mean the name of the area is korazim but We stayed in a place called the Dome of Galilea, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history especially israel i mean it's the it's totally ancient but um most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live no not at all just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? Most of the time, by the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. and you know because we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry I mean other than like little things that my children do you know especially my oldest child who's 21 you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing really gets me like really angry I haven't felt that contributing to society helping to raise responsible people I guess and of course the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it and all the stages that go. I mean, like really right now I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. So it's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and, you know, have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. So it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and, you know, changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, you know, and so you have to accept that. And I remember when I first, with my first child, thinking, you know, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. I mean, there's no going back. You cannot change. I mean, I guess you could if you did something horrible. But, I mean, in normal circumstances, you can't change that. And it's a permanent thing. And in some ways, it takes away your freedom. But in other ways, it gives you a different sort of freedom. always I'm sorry I didn't get what you said um some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so if I get emotional or I get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he gets upset about something I'm able to balance him out so it's been a that's been a great gift in my life um I don't I I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally I I occasionally I get angry but I don't like have like rarely do I have outbursts um I'm more more likely to you know to say what I feel not let it build up so you know like my husband and I don't rarely fight like have arguments that are you know yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because I like I said I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if I'm thinking something I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's 21 years old so he has the know-it-all mentality and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more and he's very confident and very self uh self-assured and so he thinks that everything he does is correct. And he still has a lot of learning to do. That's all. It can be. Mm-hmm. I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of of instant gratification which I think is going to be detrimental to the to the future of this country but you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so I I have hope that they will I mean I think this country was built on on hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um um caring honest things that um i mean my best i have well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimer's before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so I'm considered the fourth sister so I would say that those are my best friends and we love each other very much it's a good relationship no no yes most mostly minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had it off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control but now it's under control so I have a great huh um no I think it was what they call flea free floating anxiety more of a organic reason for it in other words that there was a chemical imbalance in my brain I've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great we had a good family gatherings a little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out my dad is really sick and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throes of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because i really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their 80s so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them um not easy usually all my life I think I've always I mean I'm not I've always had um at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night um to go to the bathroom basically and um other than that I mean no now I sleep well I mean other than that I sleep well but Sometimes if I wake up like really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at a school early. And there's a lot of factors. Yeah, sometimes it does. Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know But I think overall I'm probably the same My kids know I'll be I'll tell my kids though I'm really tired and they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and Maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know They may pitch in a little bit more um not really not not no not really not anything significant huh um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently, we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six-month group for DBT, it's called. And it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy, and it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter, and it's been really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to do it? Oh, my daughter was in a bad way. She was suffering a lot, and we knew it, and we acted on it. That's all. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Um, like really joyful and happy I would say probably, I mean probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the, in Cana. So, um, you know where the wedding of cana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day we flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday he turned 83 on Christmas Eve you know that kind of thing so um um that's an interesting question I would say um once I get like things done that I need to do like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done I feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like I mean I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines there's that feeling of like yeah I got it done you know so I think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished dream job hmm I think I've already lived it I'm also a birth doula and um yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and And it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do it for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. we were you know close friends and you know her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave I hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that I attended outside of you know my self-giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that I was really interesting and interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery but then I discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands-on one-on-one contact with the patient which is what I like so I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old no 16 years ago so yeah and I've been um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but and you know also like for me I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100% I'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available somebody else could fill in for me so but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me I've been able to be there for some reason so the um the the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me it was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor she would even if she had called me i would have been there in time so um went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my own birth. I mean, the birth of my own children. um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth so and I've experienced both ways I've done both natural and I my last child was by a c-section so I've had both both experiences um I with my third child I had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when I was in labor it wasn't funny and um she she was not there when the doctor I mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and woof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor but um I'm sure they weren't happy they have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that so now would I give myself for 10 or 20 years ago um 10 or 20 years ago I was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like I feel now at my age that um I I don't have the same concerns that I did then it's I don't worry about uh I don't worry at all about what people think about me I don't worry at all about what you know you know like my I notice my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this I say I don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that oh mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an intact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so I would say that's probably it Probably the, one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people that I know from church, and it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually, to me, a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Goodbye.

315,18,1," Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright. Yes. Okay, and you? in Wood, California. Yeah. No. It's okay. It's okay. You mean my girlfriend and my daughter? Yes. you know they're okay it's okay it's cool yes i do um well i'm a football recruiter so i travel uh all around the world to to sign different football players for our sports management company. Just the independence about it, being alone, being able to be free and not tied down to one thing. It's great. I remember traveling to Chicago and take them to clubs and this and that. We're not that type of organization. Yeah. um dishonesty i don't like when people are dishonest uh that really really really bothers me and not true not honest not real um that that upsets me a lot I tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind I usually take a walk or something like that or just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head I'm okay with it at times but I can definitely be better oh I argued with my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she wants to raise her one way and I think I want to raise her kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently um i don't know just angry upset you know when you're in an argument that's what you feel so you do and say things that that that bother you and you just you go on with it um yeah a little bit um I don't know I just just the way I feel I don't know I can't really say just the way I feel. A little. A little. I don't know. Just realness. um honesty truth just being straight out front um i'm pretty close um i'm pretty close with my family oh whole another subject just they're raised different um i think society is going to become even wilder the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing and everything they live in, everything's inflated so much to where it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand. I think kids these days, to a certain extent, are much wilder than I was in generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and, you know, just education-wise. I think it's just tough times for kids and the way they act. It's ridiculous to me. I definitely like to watch sports. I like to gamble. I like to travel. I like to skate. I like kind of like a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places. I'm a big movie person, so I like going to theaters, stuff like that. I'm actually living it. I always wanted to be in some kind of sports industry, and that's what I'm doing now. I just, my goal is to get a little higher in a ladder and own my own sports management company. But I'm doing pretty well for myself, so I'm happy. Yeah. No. No. No. Um, it's okay. It's pretty easy. Irritated. Tired. I don't know. It's been a while. It's been a while. A couple weeks ago. Huh? What did you say? No, not really. Okay. I think he would describe me as a stand-up guy. I try to be a good, loyal friend and an adult. I think he would describe me like that. School went to school grew up together. I've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life Yeah Very close they are my friends and I are very close We pretty much do a lot together still at this age I'm honest. I'm loyal. Very loyal. I'm a hard worker. I think I am, to a certain extent, I'm just not the average guy. I'm pretty much a different breed. I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy. I don't know just how I was raised and how my dad was kind of different and he didn't go within the crowd and I think I learned that from him a lot and it's just it's it's um kind of the same path i took um yes a lot of things i regret um i regret a lot of decisions in my life um... you know one uh... i actually let a lady of my life go years ago that i felt with my soul mate we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that break i i started dating somebody else and i told her imma go my way and she go her way i think that was a big a bad decision very bad decision yeah totally i think i could have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of uh... being so upset and moving forward uh... just upset um... i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so I need to think a little more when I'm upset. I don't know. Just experience and time. Making up for your mistakes. And being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes. think a little harder about situations and things and the decisions that you make. Think a lot longer and harder before you make them, and I think the outcome will be a little different today. my grandmother she's always been a positive influence she's a great black woman with old school ways of living so I think I've added that to my life she's a great woman and baseball and um yeah um I was a pretty good player I was a pretty good athlete growing up I was one of the top. And that started a future in athletics and that's what I wanted to do so I accomplished my goals. At the time it was a great a great thing and still is a great thing. It's a great accomplishment in my life. Accomplishments, being able to, if I have a goal or something I'm supposed to do that week or that day and I accomplish it, it always puts me in a good mood. Or getting my job done the way I'm supposed to do it in a timely fashion always puts me in a good mood. Being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our sports academy program, I think as I got older, the thought process and the way I look at life has totally changed. And I think a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say, you know, that's somebody that is a positive influence in my life. Oh, a couple days ago, my football team were in the playoffs, made the playoffs, so that always makes me happy. Thank you. Thank you.

War. I control my temper. I don't have a problem with that. I just get quiet when I feel angry and I try to think before I act. The last time I argued with someone was about a month ago and it was with my daughter and I was arguing with her over her therapy. She has cancer, and she wasn't telling me enough. She wasn't giving me enough information, and so that made me very angry. I was frustrated and angry. Yeah, it was very hard.

No one's helping their neighbor and it's very sad. I don't know. Eating dinner with my family. I regret not spending enough time on my education.

What do I think of what? Can you repeat that one more time? I still couldn't follow you. Okay. No. No. Yes. About one to two years ago. I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that I was normally interested in. And, you know, I was sort of withdrawn, and I was not able to focus on my things. So I thought maybe I should go see a doctor, and I ended up doing that. No. I lost appetite. I was not sleeping well. and I had difficulty concentrating, you know, and focusing, and I was not getting my assignments done on time. These were some of the problems. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling good. Do you still do yoga? No, I don't. Why did you stop doing yoga? I started doing yoga and I've been doing that for about a year and meditation and that's helped a lot. Awesome. What can you do about it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. and I was looking at other ways to get over the problem and then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and you know I got influenced by them. It's a little difficult but often I've been able to sleep within half an hour. there are days when it takes almost one two hours to go to sleep are they what can you repeat that no I just you know just switch off the light and you know keep tossing around and try to focus on things that makes me feel good and this and that.

I mean some of some of some of his theories you know obviously it involves a lot of deep thinking and the the first few times I read about him about his theories I had difficulty in and really understanding that and that you know we I mean when when there when there are things that I really try to understand and I am not able to and you know there are there are the type of people I admire listen to other people It's diverse and I like the entertainment industry and I like the other fact that there are more women than men here. There are certain areas where when the Spanish is spoken, I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English so that everybody can participate. What is the most important event in the U.S. in terms of the language? In L.A.? I mean, like I, some of the things the political leaders do really makes me mad. Sometimes I think they're wasting their time, our time, and other countries are advancing. and these guys don't get things done and I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. Yeah. I mean, the first four years of Obama administration, I think it was wasted because if Congress had acted together, got things done, then maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us. And the fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster, and these people still argue and find faults with each other and not get things done, And they don't seem to realize that the clock keeps ticking. They have to get things done. What kind of investment were you making?

She's going to chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to give you the doorbell, and you can ring the bell to let me know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Chicago. Really? Why'd you move to L.A.? It's cold in Chicago. I see what you mean. When'd you move to L.A.? Oh, I think in 90, 1989 actually. That's a long time. How easy was it for you to get used to living in L.A.? Oh, very simple, very easy. That's good. What are some things you really like about L.A.? Weather, of course. I'm so easily located to San Diego, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and things I like to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Smog, of course, is bad. Crime, retire, and it should be. And financial, economic problems here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Every year. Thanksgiving. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very, very much so. We're a very big family. That's so good to hear. Do you travel a lot? Yes, I do. Very much, in fact. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love flying on airplanes. I love visiting new places. I even like visiting different airports. Everyone's different. Okay. What did you study at school? Oh, let's see. I started off in pre-med. Ha ha! I ended up in physics. Cool. Are you still doing that? Yes, I teach physics and math, and higher level math. How did you decide to do that? Well, I enjoy working with kids. I enjoy teaching. My mother was a teacher. My dad was a truant officer. And I've enjoyed it. Nice. Keeps you young. What's your dream job? My dream job? My dream job would be to be a judge. Really? Yes. In the youth court. That would be fantastic. But I should have thought of that sooner than now, so I'm not going to be able to do that. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No. Not at all. Why? I enjoy people, being around people. I'm very talkative at times. I like to do a lot of things, and I'm very social when I do them. Okay. What do you do to relax? Believe it or not, I play bridge, I play chess, and I watch a good old, old movie. Audience Member 2 Awesome. What are some things that make you really mad? Dr. Ooh. Bad drivers. Bad laws. Politics often. Audience Member 2 What do you do when you're annoyed? Dr. When I'm annoyed? You know, I really don't get annoyed that much. I just let it go. It's not worth the pain and problems that it could cause. If I can't straighten out a problem, let it go. Go somewhere else. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Ooh. Always my bridge partner, but that's different. As far as anything else, I don't really argue with people. I don't argue, I don't like confrontation. I see what you mean. Mm-hmm. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on your life? My parents, of course, very, very much so. I had great parents. Can you tell me about that? Oh, my parents went to Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always wanted me to go to a black college, but of course I didn't want to do that. I went to Illinois. So they're a very positive role model for me. There are certain things that I don't do today because of them. I don't drink. I don't curse. I don't look down on people who do, but I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things. I love to drive. I love to travel. And my dad used to always take us someplace every weekend he was off. We'd go somewhere. Because we were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan, someplace in the area. We'd go to Michigan to pick fruit. Or we got all our dogs from puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in Wisconsin who was a dairy farmer. So my dad used to love to drive, and I loved to drive also. That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? That's a hard one. I've had a lot of great experiences. I think the best one was we went for my anniversary, we went to Europe. We went to Paris. and we rode the Orient Express. We didn't go all the way to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris. That was probably the best experience I've ever had in my life. I've never really cared for Europe because there's so much here in the United States to do and so much in America, and I've been to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we'd do something different, and we'd always wanted to go on the Orient Express, and we did that. Expensive, but a phenomenal trip. You gotta do it once. It's a once trip. Not once in a lifetime, just once. Awesome. Is there anything you regret? Not traveling more sooner. We did a lot when the kids were younger. But there are a lot of things we should have probably done we didn't do. I wish I had gone to Chicago. We always go to Chicago on Thanksgiving. But I think we should have gone more than just on Thanksgiving. My parents come here around Christmas time, but I think we should have done a lot more when it comes to that. Do you have done anything to avoid it? Yes, that's why it's a regret, because it could have been avoided. There are things we could have done, and we would have spent our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us. I always trade off the night. Oh, yes, very definitely. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago. I would have said don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed over them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing is promised. Have you ever served in the military? God forbid. No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very, very easy. I really have no problem with that. Once in a while, if I am anxious about something, I have things coming up due or projects due, then I get kind of anxious a little bit. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. So therefore, I do have some anxiety issues, which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure I have everything right. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I don't get irritable or anything. I'm just lethargic maybe. Just a little bit. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Very good. I was up late last night so I'm kind of tired now, but I usually have no problem sleeping. And I get a good night's sleep. That's good. Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I have not. No, not at all. I just came back off a Christmas break. I'm super very relaxed now. That's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? Oh, I have great kids. I have a son at USC. And I have a son at UCLA. And my daughter just got married. So I'm really proud of my kids. They're going to have a good life. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Being a parent is forever. What's the best thing about being a parent? Let's see. Taking care of someone else and getting them started off to have a good life. I think that that's rewarding. Making sure everything is covered. That needs to be covered with your kids, whether it's their eating, their sleeping, their clothes, make sure they're content, make sure they have no problems at school or at home or that they're safe. Physically, mentally, spiritually, everything. That makes sense. That makes sense. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would say she has not changed since high school. Level-headed, but great sense of humor. Relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Oh, I love the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything about it. I love preparing the house for it. I love baking and cooking, especially baking. I love experimenting with new recipes. And so the last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here, I felt fantastic. Everything is quiet. I'm not at work. I'm not stressed out in any way at all. I have no projects due. I have to think about it anyway. So Christmas time, holiday time. That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Really enjoyed recently? Well, Christmas of course. We went to Las Vegas the 27th of December. That was fantastic. We only stayed for two days. We had a really good time. We saw a great show. We had some great food. We drove there. We don't usually drive. I don't like to drive a lot. But we drove there and just took our time. Wow. That sounds like a great situation. It was good. It was nice. Okay.

Go to Vegas. Um, which one? Went to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas so I go there often. Um, I just take a trip, get out, get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy so I can't be away too long, you know, I love the city. Um, go to the beach. Oh, that's, that's been a problem over the years. Um, I don't know, just have a little anger, I guess. Anger, anger management problem. Um. Probably, you know, yesterday. I forget what it was about. Uh, I'll go to the gym. Um, people. Um, I don't know, just people and, uh, just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes. Okay. What's your dream job? Dream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Playa Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far the past 10 years. And then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX, and I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA airport. Yeah. What's one thing you must never have seen? Have you ever been to the military? Have you ever been to a place where they take you? I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No. Oh, I just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement, and when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time, and then I awalled from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. No problem, it's not your fault Excuse me It wasn't When I was a teenager What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager I was very restless I was very destructive, you know. Like I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but, you know, it is what it is, you know. To avoid what? going forward I guess I could try to move faster but I've accomplished my goals in life so far I just want to accomplish more but it's taking longer than I thought it would you know Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings, yeah. Are you triggered by something? When was the last time you had a fight? How did you feel about the fight? How hard is it? kinda hard to control anger, you know, when you're going through a couple, a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know. No. No. Um, my best friends. My best friends. Excuse me. They described me just like this is a character just very outgoing you know good sense of humor but you know we all have our issues you know they understand when I am going through something or I you know I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that you know very outgoing smart intelligent strong. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Just the job. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Well, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the, you know, even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What made you decide to do that? To do what? Haha. I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. Um. Going. Exercising.

325,30,1," Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm going to start with the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and then when she's done she'll let you know. And then I'm going to give you the doorbell and you can call her. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm going to start with the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and then when she's done she'll let you know. And then I'm going to give you the doorbell and you can call her. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming. I'm Ellen. Yes. I'm fine. This is a little bit strange. you know, talking to a virtual human. I was born in L.A. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived all over Los Angeles. I've lived in the Valley, Long Beach, and now I'm in Culver City. There's great food here. The weather is great most of the time. There's a lot of sunshine. It doesn't get cold. I don't have to shovel snow. There are lots of opportunities, a lot of diversity, all different sorts of people. I think that's really great. Okay. What are some things you don't really like about the way you work? That is a much longer list I would like to get out of here. The traffic, I think that's number one. I think everybody hates the traffic. And everybody's so busy all the time, it's really hard to get together with anybody. Everybody's so devoted to their jobs, and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. What did you study at school? I just graduated actually. I studied marine biology. Wow, that sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I went to school and I originally studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfulfilling. So I took a trip for a while, traveled around the world and started scuba diving and I realized that I really loved marine biology. that's how I got into it. Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated. I think I would like to, I think maybe managing a, managing a research, you know, I'm not, I'm not really sure. I think I would like to, something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve something like that it's hard question to answer I do I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world well I traveled for eight months in Central America and I visited a lot of different countries I I went scuba diving. I think intolerance, injustice in the world. Those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. Brant to my boyfriend, does that count? How are you at controlling your temper? That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? It was yesterday, actually, I argued with my boyfriend about getting a job. I was talking about taking a job somewhere, and he was being very supportive, and I really wanted him to say, no, don't go take that job for six months because I would miss you, and he was just being supportive. So we kind of argued about that, and it was ridiculous. So I ended up laughing, and that was the end of the fight. That's good. What do you do to relax? Okay. How close are you to your family? watch reality television. So we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activities. So, you know, I love them and everything, but there's not too much common ground. Yes, I think I'm a very social introvert, but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining whereas my my boyfriend for example he derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite I have to recharge I'm not sure I have a best friend but I guess I'll see my boyfriend he's he's kind of my default best friend he would probably say passionate, intelligent. He always tells me that I'm really hard on myself, which is true. Dedicated, loyal. That's great. What are you most proud of in life? I think I'm just proud of who I am. I don't know if that's the answer that most people give, but I think that I'm really proud of who I am. I try really hard. I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a really good person. I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind, and I consider myself a kind person that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of that. No, I have not. No. Yes. I was probably about 15 at the time so I think eight what is that 17 years ago yes um I was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment I that wasn't the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but before it was more they thought I had ADHD so it was I think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help I haven't for about three years I stopped because it felt like I was checking with a parole officer I just wasn't enjoying the relationship I had but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for med checks I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist I think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful I have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back lately I've been a little bit down I should say a little bit more down than usual because I graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24-7 has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in California. Audience Member 4 Yeah, that sounds really hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Almost impossible. Ever since I was a little kid I had trouble falling asleep and about four years ago it became really, really bad where I just couldn't sleep through the night I was getting about four hours of sleep sometimes I would wake up every hour and I'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years I've been taking trazodone so I can sleep have you ever seen Fight Club you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that I I'm just a complete panicked anxious wreck. I lose my ability to deal with things. I'm much more likely to lose my temper. I can't regulate my moods. I'm just really volatile. Probably a few months ago, I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a weekend, and forgotten to take my medicine with me or something like that and then I can't sleep and so that's what happens. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy I mean I don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when I feel really really bad. Really happy I guess I felt happy on New Year's really happy on New Year's which was 10 days ago. I was with my boyfriend and some friends, and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree, and it was really nice to see them. I don't get to see them very often because I've been in school and I've been so busy, so it was a really nice reintroduction to real life. That's great. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I think that I'm kind, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant. I'm pretty open-minded. I'm aware of my faults. I just try to be nice to everybody and I'm very curious about the world and things that I don't know about. I really like to learn. Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is diving the blue hole in belief. It was really amazing. It was me and my friends. We just, you know, jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole and it's really, really, really blue. And you just drop down to about 140 feet in something like two minutes. We did it pretty quick. Not everybody could do it that quick. and as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than a human because it's this cave system and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so that was that was pretty good I'm trying to remember that at the moment I haven't had much free time the last three and half years being in school. So I guess reading, hiking, just being together with my friends, doing relatively low-key things, going to movies, having dinner parties, cooking, playing with my cat. Not that I can really think of. I'm sure I've made mistakes in my life, but you know, I'm still here so can't be that bad hmm I don't know hang in there hold on to your clothes because the 90s are coming back in fashion Cloudy weather, beautiful sunsets, being out in nature, kind of being away from the hubbub of the city, getting a good grade. I think my boyfriend has. He's just, especially the last year, he's really inspired me. He quit drinking. He quit smoking. He's made a lot of positive changes in his life. And I know that those things aren't hard or aren't easy, I should say. So to see someone overcome that really inspired me. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Bye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/325_P/325_AUDIO.wav,1

It was very cold there in the winter and our summers are very short. It was very easy. I custom pretty quick. No, not very much anymore. I don't have much family in the United States and it's pretty expensive to go back home so i only go every couple of years meeting different people different places different customs uh... well we just recently went to uh... san francisco same custom and everything but the city was very different and i enjoyed it I took general education and child development.

I'm sorry to hear that. How do you cope with that? Oh, now it's easy because they're grown and they live on their own, so it's a lot easier now, but you still worry even though they're grown.

I went to a counselor and then to group therapy. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Yes. Can you tell me about that? I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems, and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are, and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better.

328,18,1," Okay, now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And when she says goodbye, I'm going to give you the doorbell. So then when she says goodbye, just ring it and let me know you're done. Okay. Hey. Yes. So, how are you doing today? Fine, how are you? I'm great, thanks. Where are you from and with whom? Watts, California, but now I live in West LA. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the sunshine, I love the palm trees, I love that you're 30 minutes away from everything. It's a great city. Yeah. What are some things you know about traffic? What do you study at school? Are you still working on that? Awesome. What's your dream job? My dream job is to be a filmmaker. That's what I want to do. I want to die doing that job, making movies. Well, when I was in high school, I did a lot of drama, theater productions, and I just love everything about film. So once I had the opportunity to actually make a film, because I wasn't getting any work as an actor, I just got hooked. I just love making film. last time I made a film just this last October made a short film it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally thanks really mad uh really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school no it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy the hardest thing about being a parent i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't want to take it they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they want to come to you like i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so yeah i guess for a while when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they want to learn because once they get it they got it so however they get it and as a parent you're happy they got it all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they yeah they you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like what does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that oh my god they're whoo they're you know like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity. And there's so much technology out there. Kids are learning so fast. It's almost like they're already little adults, but they're missing the steps to being a child. They miss going outside. They miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to YouTube or, you know, wherever, Facebook and getting it so fast. And they don't know what to do with all this information. And they just have to fight through all that info. and it's not organic anymore. Children growing up these days, it's not organic. It's sped up, it's pushed, and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world. So that's what's wrong. Hmm. Me? Just breathe in and breathe out. I'll just walk away from the situation. I argued with my fiance a couple months ago about, gosh, I forgot. I forgot. I don't remember. It was petty. Yeah. But it didn't last long because she's like me. She doesn't like to argue about stuff. We like to take care of stuff as it happens. And that's it. how do you know them my fiance um well i mean we met um when i was working at at a not a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year and then we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since my family we're pretty close my brother lives in Colorado my sister lives in Oklahoma I have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where I am as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away but my immediate family like you know my fiance and my daughter like we're close and it's great okay yeah I don't travel Enough, but I have traveled a couple of times within the last five years. I just came back from New Zealand, so that was a great experience. Yeah. I enjoy meeting new people. That's the biggest thing about traveling. I like seeing new things. I like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations. and I like just being away from it all. That's good too. Well, I went to New Zealand not too long ago and I stayed there for a week. I learned about Celsius because here we have Fahrenheit and that was fun. I learned how to play cricket. I learned how to get myself out of a cap-sized kayak and I learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good I like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and there's seafood I can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is so good and ice cream was good too and the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there was great and they accepted me. I love that. And yeah, can't wait to go back. Yes, it was. Some of my best qualities, energetic, very personable, intelligent. I am easy to get along with. I work pretty hard and I'm very slow to getting upset about things. No. No. No. It's fairly easy. I guess I get pretty moody. You know, I could be a little snappy at people when I don't sleep well, when I have lack of sleep. But once I get some sleep in me, I'm okay. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Fine. That's good. Have you had a stay-at-home experience in the last few weeks? No, no, no changes, no. Okay. How are your best friends right now? You know, he would say that I'm pretty funny, lax about a lot of things. I enjoy life as much as I possibly can. Good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help. Okay. just waking up in the morning that's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good i love laughing oh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee because she has a great laugh then that puts me in a good mood thank you and that's what I want to do I definitely want to get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend yeah yes it is wow there's so many uh I had these bag of M&M's and we had went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that, you know, we didn't particularly care for. But, you know, that's how kids are. They don't know how to, you know, they say they don't like somebody. But, you know, anyway, but we got these M&M's. And while it was dark, we start throwing M&M's and hitting them in the head with M&M's. And then we came to school like three days later, we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get. So we were able to get ourselves off, unlike the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime. And but then we got in trouble anyway, because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble. So we had to clean up the yard for like two days. Oh, man, you name it. I love scuba diving. I've only done it twice, but I love it. Want to get back into it. Like traveling. I love exercising. I actually like working out now. I used to think it was a chore, but now I'm really, really getting into it. I love watching movies. you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so that's about it hanging out with family i think i regret hmm you know what i think i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance Can you tell me about that? Yeah, Will Smith was coming up the street and I saw him and I got so nervous I jumped in the bushes and I didn't meet him. My boss at the time thought it was really funny but I just, I wasn't ready to meet him yet so, but I think I regret meeting him. advice I would give myself 10 or 20 years ago I would probably say that when my gut told me to do something I should have just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if I feel it in my gut I should go for it so go with my gut more really happy really happy I had a film festival that I was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago yeah let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget, but it has amazing actors. It has a great storyline, and I didn't think it could be done, but it's done or close to being done, and I'm proud of that. I was able to get it done. I think I could walk away happy knowing that I gave it a really good shot, and I think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights. That's great. Oh really? Alright. What was your name again? Ah. Ellie. Goodbye. Goodbye. That was awesome. Yeah.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/328_P/328_AUDIO.wav,0

Aerospace engineering. That sounds nice. How did you decide to do that? I was really good at math and science and I had an interest in airplanes. Are you still working on that? No. What do you do now? I'm a life coach. What's your dream job? To be a life coach and help people. Tell me more about that.

How close are you to them? Really close. That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on your life? I'm a meditation teacher. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety. And I worry a lot about the future. And I took classes, meditation and yoga classes, and it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more. Meditate and do yoga. Let's see, really mad. I guess, I don't know about mad. I don't get mad that often, but frustrated, I would say like being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason. What do you do when you're annoyed? I usually talk to somebody about it if I can, or if I can't, then I'll usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? With my girlfriend and it was about, she was driving on the freeway and I suggested that she get over because there were some road workers on the side. and she refused to do that and stayed in the right lane. So we argued a bit about that. I felt like she wasn't listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what I suggested to be defiant. No. What are some things you like to do for fun? Rollerblade, kayak, sing. I sing in a choir. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? A trip I took to India and Nepal for six weeks. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to go on a trip. Well, I went on a trip to India and Nepal. It was my first time ever there. The first week and a half, I was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat and went whitewater rafting on the Ganga River. And then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip. I went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there. And it was just really beautiful in the Annapurna area. And then I went back into India and explored the area up near Tibet. And then I went to Rajasthan and to a tiger park in Madai Pradesh. It was like really close to tigers. I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this trip. and I'd always wanted to go to India so I decided to do it. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was really fun. How would your best friend describe you? Um, caring and enthusiastic for life. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No. No. No. Pretty easy. I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger, but for the most part I sleep well. Once in a while I'll wake up at like 4 in the morning or 5 in the morning when I want to sleep until 7 and not be able to get back to sleep. but in general it's pretty good. I feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. No. 10 or 20 years ago I guess too I wish I would have invested money or bought like a house or something when I was younger that would probably be the advice I would give myself I am empathetic with other people positive and kind of have a positive outlook on life very determined when I decide to do something I'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging I'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced. I'm very organized, but I'm also pretty creative. So I'm pretty balanced that way. That's good. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. Much closer than I was when I was younger. although I'd say I'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than I'm able to get to my family. Okay. What are some things that you would put in your family? Being outdoors in nature and exercising and also singing. the fact that I've gone with followed my heart and then what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do I guess yesterday I spent the day by the beach and just bicycled and went skating and visited some old friends there. Felt very relaxed and invigorated. And also felt like I missed living by the beach because I used to live really close to the beach. So I guess a little bit sad that I didn't live there anymore but really happy to be there. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/329_P/329_AUDIO.wav,0

Yes, I'm okay with this. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Very good. That's good. Where are you from originally? L.A. Really? What are some things you really like about L.A.? It's sunny, and it's near the ocean. Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about L.A.? the traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places. And there's a lack of open spaces if you're not near the beach. Uh, no. I haven't planned on, I haven't finalized any travel plans. Okay. What do you do to relax? Listen to music. Cool. You can do this all day, right? Yeah. Why? Well, I tend to excel at things that have to do with spending time alone versus things that have to do with spending time outside with lots of people. I'm reasonable. I'm reasonable. Maybe yesterday I was trying to figure out how to pack something into the car. I'm very good at it. What do you do when you're in the water? I breathe in and out. Like that. Okay. That's good. What are some things you like to do in the morning? I like jogging, walking, bicycling, reading, listening to music. Awesome. What do you study at school? Math, engineering, computers. Are you still working in that? A little bit, yeah. What do you do now? I'm a student. I'm going back to school for biological sciences. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I started doing some reading on some textbooks. books. Medical doctor. I guess it depends on what type of medicine you practice uh... of a mentor Yeah, I have a mentor who has a lot of positive thoughts and suggestions. How do you know them? I, through a professional, so I met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally. So it's, I guess you could say through an academic or professional channel. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Hmm. Let's see. What are my most memorable? I can't think of one at the moment. No. No. I don't think so, no. Takes me a little while to fall asleep, but once I'm asleep, it's reasonably okay. Okay. I think I'm a little forgetful and nervous. No. Sometimes. Can you tell me about that? What do you want to know? Whatever comes to your mind. Well, I think sometimes I do think about challenges ahead of me. And, uh, that can be a little daunting and I feel down. It is very hard. Go for a walk, read a book, listen to some music. I don't, I mean I'm sure they are. I'm not specifically sure what triggers anything. Maybe feeling overwhelmed or not feeling particularly tied to some task. Is going to a therapist helping you? I don't go to a therapist. Okay. How are your best friends? Um, reasonably smart, inquisitive, and curious. I guess through classes. Uh, somewhat. Patience and curiosity. That's good. Tell me about something you didn't enjoy. Uh. Enjoy at home. Hmm.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answer is completely confident. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Connecticut. Really? Why did you move to LA? To be an actor. How did you decide to do that? Well, I moved to San Francisco in 94 and then I moved to Atlanta in 96 and then I moved out here to be an actor and I became a realtor instead. What's your dream job? How hard is it to be an actor? Do you travel a lot? don't travel that much. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The weather. There's always something to do. That's pretty much it. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The people here tend to be a little more rude. It's just always a fast It's just always a fast pace. Well, when I moved here, I was 25. So it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city, you can have a lot of fun. And then I got into the real estate and did really well for a while. And then the market crashed. And so now I'm old and I'm not making any money. So times are tough. No, no, I'm much more of an extrovert. What are some things that make you really mad? When I don't get what I want and rude people and just inconsiderate people. I'm pretty good at controlling my temper when I'm not like if I if I drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but when I don't drink I'm pretty good at controlling my temper the last time I argued with somebody was somebody that owed me money I live in West Hollywood no no no I live alone I have a dog it's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in are not that noisy and the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with me huh why because they because my hardwood floors they say that i've been there for 10 years and And they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors. Yeah. What was the question? My mother has been a very positive influence. She's always kept me on track. She lived with me for the last 10 years until she recently moved to Rhode Island to live with my brother. Very close to my mother. Not so close with my brother. We're close, but we're not like close, close. So, I mean, we love each other. We just don't really understand each other all the time. Outgoing, life of the party, ambitious, and sometimes cutthroat. What am I most proud of? Being always able to get through the things I need to get through to get to where I want to be. That's great. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm generous. I'm loyal. I'm friendly. I'm accommodating. I'm accommodating and that's about it. No. Yes. About four years ago. What got you into these problems? I was beaten up and I had identity theft. I was just afraid to go out so I needed to get over that. After spending one year in my home without leaving and just depressed all the time, I said I have to get out and start talking to people and so I did. I'm sorry you're leaving. Thank you. How have you been feeling lately? Okay, I'm panicky about the job situation, you know, because my bills are pretty high and I don't really have a steady income right now. So that's what's worrying me the most is my financial situation. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, well, basically it's like I just recently quit drinking altogether, so I don't drink anymore. So I'm noticing, yeah, I mean, it's good because number one, I don't have the money, and number two, I don't like the way I act when I drink. So that's a positive thing. But when I was drinking, it helped me just forget and numb myself. Now I have to feel through the feelings, which is pretty good because I can talk my way through them. So I guess I'm evolving. That's good. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yeah, a long time ago. I've taken many medications here and there. Some of them would numb me. Some of them would make me feel hyper. So I've recently decided in the last six months, three to six months, just to not take anything. So I don't take anything. I barely even take an aspirin just to get my body to a normal state. Not really. Always worrying. Just a lot of worrying. Always worrying, worrying, worrying about everything. Oh, what happens if I get in a car accident? What happens if I can't pay my mortgage? What happens if I... Just so many things I worry about, and that's what was making me depressed. Do you feel like there's a reason? I do. At some point, I've had some good therapists and I've had some bad therapists. I tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kind of give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen and then they just say, okay, your time's up, and just prescribe me medication. So I think I'd be better with a psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist. Yeah. I think it would be nice. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Well, I'm not going to therapy now, but the therapy that I had before was more like people trying to, just come in and check in and give me medication. I have had other therapy where I was back and forth, like, okay, well, this is what I think about this, and you think about this, and that kind of therapy is better. Why did you stop? I just, I wasn't getting the right therapists recently. So, and I knew the root of my problem was the drinking, because it's a depressant. So, you know, stopping the drinking has definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself, you know. I can't really think of anything right now. It's been a long time. I can't really think about a time when I felt really happy. Thank you. Okay, when I was a kid, I had a little dog. And this big dog came and attacked it and killed it. So then, a little while later, my father came and he says to my brother and me, we were kids, go to the car, there's two packages in the car, so go get them. So I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because I never listened to my parents. So I was like a spoiled brat. But finally he said, go to the car. What's that? Okay. He said, go to the car and get this out of the car. So I finally went. When I opened the door, there was a new dog and a bag of dog food. So that's one of my memorable experiences. That's great. Yeah, because I'm an animal lover. Yeah. What do you mean by that? And just the way that I've treated people before when I was hurting, I was really mean or rude to people. When I felt like, you know, I was hurting, I had to hurt everybody around me. So, but ever since I stopped the drinking, I don't do that anymore. So I think the problem is the drinking. And so now that I've let that go, because I was doing it for the wrong reasons. You know, I was doing it to not feel. I wasn't doing it to be sociable. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Get in a career that is really stable. Like a doctor or a nurse or an attorney. Something that, you know, or in advertising. I should have gone into that. A sales position is, it could be very well, very good, or very bad. So you always have to be on it in sales. You can make a ton of money in sales. But when you make your money, save your money. Don't go spending it on extravagant things. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? When I have a job. When I'm able to work. When I'm helping other people. When other people around me are happy and laughing. When I can make people laugh. That puts me in a good mood. That's great. Okay. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Bye. Okay. Is this modeled after a real person, or is it just like they just... Is this like somebody's avatar, or no? Yeah, I think it was modeled after a real person. I'll chat with you a little bit about Ellie after you finish the post-survey.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/331_P/331_AUDIO.wav,1
332,58,2," so important. I wonder if people really like understand it. You know what I mean? Like if people do judge, yeah. Bizarre. I did like the Ricky Lake show with my friend and I saw myself on TV. Oh my God. Yeah. But I was eating, I was, I was eating candy and I was going to like that. And, and then I was looking at Ricky Lake, like there must be something around my eyes because I was like she was like right there I don't know and so I had to actually like act you know I'm in the audience but I had to like pretend like I was interested in what you had to say but I looked so I kept looking at her like that like there's something wrong in my eyes no I just saw I was in a doctor's office and they had it on and like oh god it was funny because there was these guys like winking at me on the way out like that was celebrity and I'm like I didn't pay to do audience sitting there it's like I hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines free sewing machines $200 sewing machines that day it was yeah so it was worth it was worth it but I was so embarrassed yeah only if you get stuff it's worth it otherwise they're so stupid the shows are so I can't believe that's why I don't watch television it's so embarrassing okay right on okay this is so weird oh gosh I hope she's nice to me I hope so okay hello Yes. Yes. Fine. Just tired. Where are you from in California? From Hollywood. What are some things you like about it? What are some things you like about it? The people. It's not clean. too much crime too many drugs makeup and hair is a little bit not too much I just survive. Very difficult. I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career, but I just want probably to get married and have a little security, that's all. just be a wife again. A little bit close, but everybody's pretty much passed away. I play Farmville on Facebook. I'm good I don't really have a temper it was my ex-husband about money people lying cheating, conniving, drug addicts, you know, just ugly people, people that are hideous on the inside, you know. Jesus Christ, that's about it. my mother when she was alive, well she still has a positive influence, but nobody really, but Jesus. I don't know. What's one thing that's been a big thing for you? Memorable experiences... I don't know, I can't really think of one right now. What did you think of the experience? Gosh, all experiences. Oh, I guess like maybe modeling, that was pretty cool. Nice. Yeah. Did you learn anything about that? I was just kind of surreal, like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff, you know. I didn't understand how it could have been me, but then my photographer told me, he was like, well, someone has to do it, it might as well be you. So, oh well, and it's true. So that was cool. Just kind of fell into it by accident. I've always, yeah, yeah, I wish I did it, I took it further, but I couldn't. Really happy? I don't remember. I really don't. Okay. How are your best friends? I don't really have a best friend, but I'm sure anybody would describe me as outgoing. That's good. Yeah. Have you ever spoken to them? No. Have you ever contacted them? Yes. It was 1984. Yeah. I couldn't deal with it. So I had to see a psychiatrist. Horrified. couldn't sleep, panicked, major anxiety. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes, I do. It could be, if you see the right doctor. It gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody, and hopefully they can give you answers. Most of them don't. They try to find the answers inside of you, get it out of you, but it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of bias neutral. How do you feel about being depressed? Really depressed. Extremely depressed. How do you feel about being depressed? Yeah. Are you different by some point? Poverty. Are you tired of sleeping longer? yeah I'm a lot more tired I sleep longer and I am I just don't have the drive motivation that I did before How do you help with that? Just try to be strong. Just have to get through it. You know? Do you have any friends who are open? Yes. There are. Do you have any friends who are open? Not really. I'm an open book. That's good. Yeah. What would you say is the most important thing about you? I don't know. Well, I would say a perfectionist, but that's not really a good quality because it can get dangerous. I'm just artistic. I'm good at a lot of things. I'm really good at a lot of things. but well I'm good I'm a good hairdresser and makeup artist I crochet and knit really well make jewelry not good with computers or phones though electronics yeah I keep a perfect house or well when I'm not depressed like this I was a perfect wife the perfect wife so yeah but not anymore because I'm divorced now but it wasn't me it was him so he was on drugs so he chose the drugs were too much problems yeah it does It's really hard because it's like the drugs are as mischievous. How do I what? Who? Who? Oh. Yes. No. But. well I don't really consider myself an introvert yeah I have a lot of regrets but there really wasn't anything I could do about it so there's really no point in regretting it because you do what you do and you make a decision and then it's already done, so why regret it? Why bother? Make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. That's one for sure. that was the only question I didn't ask I didn't know there's a lot of things a lot of stuff you know I don't know just the things that I can do that my talents that's it well if I can have my Starbucks and my orange Gina I drink orange Gina every day and I smoke cigarettes unfortunately but it's always good to have those because you know I'm addicted to them and then if I can eat something really good and healthy at nighttime and but I well basically if I have something to do if I have a goal somewhere to go something to do like today even puts me in a good mood yeah otherwise I'd be afraid that I'd stay home and just lay in bed or perform all day I could farm for eight hours on Farmville yeah you're welcome nice to meet you so I press the button okay you're good She's good. Except for, you know, it's like the one eye. Can she hear me, by the way? The one eye always kind of moves weird. Oh, does it? Yeah, it's kind of distracting. It's good to know. Yeah, the one eye. I'll tell you more about her and how she feels and everything and what her purpose is after we're done. So I'm going to stop the recording and then we just have the quick post survey. Yeah, she kind of made a mistake on one part.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/332_P/332_AUDIO.wav,1
333,23,1," collection alright Yes. Very well. New York. This turned the volume up a little bit. Oh, yeah, sure. Okay, I'll wait here to make sure it's okay. Why didn't it go in? For a change. That's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. How easy was it for you to get used to living in New York? Can you tell me about that? I can't even. What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you really like about LA? I think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places I was a history major no I do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets What's your dream job? Really? How hard is that? Yeah, that's tough. How did you decide to do that? in films ever since I was a child. And I just always was writing and had an active imagination. In the last probably almost 10 years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled. Even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am, seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on, on the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. oh yeah that's one of the great experiences of my life and i also got to uh a place in egypt at the end of that trip um called uh sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that egypt would but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling. What do I do to relax? I do, I like to listen to music. I like to, watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of, you know, whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I I like to take walks in nature. That's always calming, especially down by the ocean. That's good. What do you do when you're in the light? It depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. And also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way, that we could all get along and make the world better. What was the last time you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film, and I didn't think it was done very well. it's not so much that we had a fun argument about uh about the movie so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind is there anything i regret yeah there's there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a grip, and I probably should have pursued that. How did you decide to do that? How did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the question. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important. And no matter how you feel. You know, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. No. No. No, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. I think, you know, sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind, that can bring me down. But I can, you know, usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity. How do I explain it? financial is one way if I had made another decision I might have more money or my life would be different um not really I mean I feel pretty much the same What got me to seek help for... Let's come back to that. Okay. How has seeing your kids helped you? Well, generally talking to someone has helped when I did do that. That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good name? Pretty easy. I don't have a problem sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. So if I don't sleep well, you know, I feel tired and irritable. How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. Well, I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier. I think it's tough it depends sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write so that takes means that I have to spend time alone and then when I come out of that I'm extroverted so I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation in my mood. My best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likable personality. You know, people have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's sort of a cool detachment and creative, intuitive. Yes. Last time I felt really happy, I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining. That's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond human in a way, just more in touch with everything, the universe. yeah it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but what am i most proud of in my life i think i've uh helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, you know, I've written some screenplays. I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just, you know, being connected with someone else, you know. spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels. Okay. Okay. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? It could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something, you know, if I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, you know, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive. It puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. And then it would ask me this question about, and I was like, I don't remember it really kind of getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? Okay. It kind of asked me, well, are you depressed? And I was like, well, sometimes. You know, and then it will explain that, and then it was like, well, and then it did something, and then it was like, well, you know, did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, there was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/333_P/333_AUDIO.wav,0
334,32,1," I can see, I mean I don't know exactly her face, but I can see that's a woman. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. Okay. I have a few questions to get started. And please feel free to contact me. Your answers are absolutely confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. A little tired. Okay. Where are you from originally? Seattle, Washington. When I was 18, my mom and dad decided we wanted to move to California, and so we moved down to Pasadena, actually Monrovia first, and I've been here ever since. How long did you go back to your hometown? I did about two years ago. I went up for work and look around the area. Pretty easy, actually. I do adapt. The warm weather, not having rain nine months of the year. People mainly. What are some things you don't really like about the area? The area, how big it is, the traffic. When I first got here, the smog. That's better now. Yeah. I think you can do yourself a favor. No. When I was younger, I was, but I got out of that work I did. Can you tell me about that? Sure. When my mom died and I needed work, I went for a job that was called petitioning. And you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions. And you do that. After a while, you don't get shy about talking to anybody. Also, when I was in school, I took public speaking, and I learned that I really liked it more than I thought I would. So when I did the census job, I actually got up in front of groups of people and talked to them and showed them how to take the test. and I enjoyed it. Okay. What do you do now? Right now I'm working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance. And I'm going to start work trying to get money from people to help kids in the world. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, the one, the job helping kids was also a paid job, and I needed a paid job. The one for insurance was I was getting older, and I needed work that was steady, and that's something I can do until I'm 85 or 90 or whatever. What's your dream job? To be an artist. Really? Tell me more about that. I've always been good with art. I like drawing, painting, etc. But I didn't know if I could ever make a living in it. So I never really got into it. And every time I tried, it seemed I never got anywhere. So maybe when I get like 80 or 90, maybe I'll go into ceramics or something and do that as a profession. No, unfortunately I don't. That's okay. How close are you to your family? I'm not. My mom and dad are dead. I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or I don't talk to them anymore or like that. That sounds really hard. I have kind of an attitude that if I have me and friends I have, then I'm okay. Okay. What do you do to relax? Read. Watch sports when they're available. Let's see. I used to play golf. I may do that again someday, but not right now because of the cost and the time. People are rude. I usually ignore it. This morning actually I told the guy to stop what he was doing and we got kind of an argument about it and then the argument was over and it was done. How long did it take you to control it? Very good because I had a very bad temper when I was a kid and I told myself I had to control it. When was the last time you argued with someone? This morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise on purpose in a place that was just not the place to do it. I mean, it was a public place, and that was it. Just a little argument, and I'm done with the argument once I say what I say. Yes. Not right now that I can think of. What are some things you like to do for fun? Like read. If I can't travel, I travel. I don't travel long distances, but even going out to Riverside is kind of an adventure for me. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing things on the way and back. Talking to people maybe. That's great. I'd love to do that when you could. Well, a number of years ago I drove back east to Massachusetts to do work back there. On the way back, I took a Greyhound bus all the way back from Washington, D.C., all the way back to California into Washington first and then down from there. And worked in Massachusetts for about six months to eight months. Enjoyed the area quite a bit, but didn't want to be there when the snow came. And enjoyed coming back on the bus. had people near next to me almost all the way different people and had a lot of fun yeah yeah i was in the air force and when i was 18 1965 during the vietnam war no i was in great falls montana how did serving in the military change you It really didn't. Years later I probably learned more from the fact that I got out early and maybe I should have stayed in and stuck with it. I tended to quit things when I was younger and so now with that and other things I decided never to quit anything. I came down here, played pool for a number of years, finally graduated from high school, which I dropped out of when I moved. Went on to college, got my bachelor's degree and an AA degree at Pasadena in Cal State LA, and started working various jobs, and that's about it. Took care of my mom. business. I was my major. I also studied things like anthropology and philosophy and history, etc. No. No, never do. Lately, not so good between the fact that I sleep in my car and it's very cold and that sometimes I do get, and with all the things going on in my life right now, I think of things. And plus I get up at 4.30 in the morning. That's okay. I'm tired. And I get a little grumpy sometimes, but not very much. Tired. with all the things I've had to do and the weather and the sleep. No. A little bit sometimes about how maybe I should have started doing all this years ago. How do you cope with that? I just go on. I tell myself to basically stop it and go on doing things to improve myself. How hard is that? Not very anymore. It took me years to study that and to do that. I don't know if you call it Zen or not, but... When was the last time you felt really happy? A couple months ago, I passed all my tests, and I met Medicare Advantage. I passed every one of them for every company that sent them to me. I stick to everything I do now. I'm persistent. I don't let things get out of hand before I do something about it. I used to be what's the word I put off things I don't do that anymore and I treat people nicely always until I'm given a reason not to and I don't talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually not very because the same thing I've trained myself over the years to not talk about myself. I talk to other people. I talk about them. Let's see. My mother, Gandhi, Bertrand Russell. Let's see. I'm not sure who else. other people I've had but I don't remember their names or they were teachers etc. Earlier in life like I said stopping everything not completing things that I regret very much. Yeah, I could have done better. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Probably the advice I gave myself, to get off my butt and go learn, get an education, and get on with my life and do something. What is the most proud of you in the moment? that I've survived. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Well, I'm 65. I've been sleeping in my car for a number of years. I went from sleeping on pavement to where I got a car. While I've done that, I've improved my credit rating. I've gotten a number of jobs that I've been very happy with. I've had a lot of friends. both whole people that are homeless and non homeless and I'm in pretty good health And whereas other people in my family have died young So I guess that's about it Good jokes people having a happy time, going to have a drink with somebody on an occasional basis. About eight months ago was the last time I went and had a beer with someone. Let's see. Probably getting within one foot of a live wild deer. Tell me more about that. It was in Green Lake in Washington. I was out behind our house and this wild buck deer was walking in the field. I started motioning to it and it came within about one foot of me. and the only reason it left, my dad drove down the driveway, and it made noise, and the deer ran off. I was in petting distance of him, and I wasn't too sure if I should have petted him or not, but I was about to. Thank you. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Bye. Bye. She's pretty cool for a knot. She is pretty cool. So I'm going to have you take off the headset and I'm going to stop the recording.

335,33,1," Okay, so now I'm going to start up a virtual human who will chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll let you know, and I will put the doorbell right next to you, and you can ring it when you're done, okay? Okay, sounds good. All right, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist. I want to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and start. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from here originally, Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather and my family's here, which is why I'm here. I've moved away for a while. I like that there's a lot of, even though everyone says there's no culture in LA, there is a lot of culture. There's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that, all different kinds of people. I like the diversity. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about your life? Um, well, I don't like that I had to move back kind of against my will. So starting a new career, starting over in my career. So that's not really something. Well, I moved back because my dad was sick. So thank you. Thank you. So that's why I'm here. But it also means I live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous. Acting. Theater. It was. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I am. I'm an actor. Right now I'm doing a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and that sort of thing. How did you decide to do that? Well, my parents are both artsy people, and I grew up around it, and for a long time I was singing, and then I went to study musical theater, and somewhere along the lines I realized that acting was more my bag than singing, I suppose. But I still do both. That's great. Mm-hmm. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No, I don't. Why? I don't usually have trouble talking to people. I'm pretty friendly. I can get along with most people. People usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me, which I feel like is a mark of an extrovert. What do you do to relax? I take a bath or read a book, go out with my friends, go to the theater. Sometimes my work is very relaxing, so sometimes just like singing a song and get that going for a walk. Yoga. Yoga. Things that make me mad. injustice I can be very righteously indignant I suppose people who don't see those things and people who have entitlement I think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad yeah what do you do when you're annoyed? it depends a lot of times I argue my case, I guess. Or I call my best friend usually and complain. Talk to her about it. Pretty good. Pretty good. I don't have too much of a temper. Like a real argument or like a debate? If it was a real argument, it probably would be my ex-boyfriend, and we just argued about why we broke up, stupid things like that. I think I was kind of over it by then, but it was at times. um last time I felt really happy was really happy probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night I had a good time yeah uh Tanya Cushman Reviewer's Name Reviewer's Name It is. It's nice. It's nice. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would describe me as an open book. She often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything. She would describe me as compassionate and having a strong sense of who I am. I think, yeah, she also, she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes, probably. That's something that she makes fun of me for. Because I do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that I have like holes in my clothes and things like that. but nothing bad. We have a very good relationship. Hmm? Yeah, yeah, it has. Not terrible trouble, but yeah, it's gotten me in trouble before, sure. No, I haven't. No, but I think I had it. But I never went to a doctor. um because I had a I had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me and I I when I looked up PTSD later I really I felt like I had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that I would get panicky and um it was very uh I held on to it for a really really long time I think um I think that I did have it but I just I don't know because I I never saw anyone about it. Oh, no. Are you triggered by something? Sometimes, yeah. Certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger. Or it happened in an acting class. So sometimes certain teachers, if they criticize in a certain way, I start to panic even if they're totally right and I know they're right and it's something that someone else could tell me and I'd be fine with it sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky Have you been diagnosed with depression? No How have you been feeling lately? Well, I mean my dad is sick, so not great but considering, not terrible um I've been having bad dreams uh just like stress dreams I think having to do with my dad um like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you look them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so which way okay easy very easy I am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy I get really goofy yeah Okay. What would you say is some of your best qualities? I am fairly non-judgmental of other people. I stay open-minded. I can make most people laugh. I'm funny. Creative. I, yeah, those are some of the best ones, I'd say. I love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning and just getting out of the routine. I like staying in hotels. I like most things about traveling. I even like flying. I like all of it. well I just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the U.S. and uh performing for kids all over yeah and then we ended here in L.A. yeah yeah it was great it was a good time Awesome. Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Let me think. We went to the hot springs, the naturally occurring hot springs in Colorado. And that was really nice. That was a nice way to unwind. That's good. Yeah. Who's some of the people that you love in the community? A lot of people. I would say, I mean, my dad comes to mind, certainly. My godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well. My best friend. My best friend from high school. I think I, a few of my best friends from high school and college that I've kind of grown up with and become who I am with them. Yeah. That's great. Mm-hmm. Is there anything you regret? Small things, sure. Can you give me an example of that? I regret the way that I dealt with a friendship that was ending once. I regret committing to certain people that I've dated. but nothing huge I tend to go well I won't do that again but I don't spend a lot of time being upset about things I've done in the past stand up for yourself don't date felons I think that I I don't have any trouble standing up for things that I believe in but sometimes I have trouble standing up for myself I think I I really internalize the idea of like you know women being too needy or uh or um I don't know those kinds of things and then and so as as an adolescent and growing up I felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what I want what I needed from other people and be okay with that and it's still something I work on I'm glad you think so That's a good question. My friends and family and my talents, I would say. Yeah. That's great. Yeah, my ability to take situations and take bad situations and continue and make the best of everything. All right. Thank you.

I like singing. Singing? What are some things you really like about LA? Uh, diversity. My girlfriend's from Taiwan, so dealing with different cultures. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic, the crazy people. It seems hard to get anything really accomplished. It took me about six months just to figure out the directions. When did you go to Berlin? Twenty-eight years ago. Wow, that's a long time. A long time. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there in about 8 or 10 years. Why? Well, I don't like my brothers so I don't want to hang around them. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I started my girlfriend, we did about, just went back, got back from Orlando and she likes to travel. Nice. What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about your trip. which is like raise your consciousness and clean out the crap in your head. Are you happy with that? Yeah, I feel better. I have a lot of psychic attack. I'm psychic, so it's very hard to deal with it. Wow. Tell me more about that. Well, there is more to life than what you see. A lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so you have to deal with not only the emotions but people direct energy at you. How hard is that? Well, to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself. Okay. You consider yourself an introvert? I am both. Why? Well I'm introverted because I like to spend time by myself and I'm extroverted because I like to meet new people. I used to be totally an introvert. What do you do to relax? Watch movies, watch TV, read, do crosswords, I'm a singer, sing, write music, I'm writing a novel. What was it about? It's sort of like the Matrix. Awesome. How hard is that? Well, I wrote the first 20 pages pretty quick, so now I'm expanding it. What made you decide to do that? I get inspiration. It was actually a dream and then I wrote down the dream and now it's becoming, I could probably turn it into a movie. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. What are some things that you're really not? When people don't respect me, that's the number one. Do you feel that way often? No, I just said my brothers, they don't respect me. They don't really, you know, I want to love my family, but I don't want to hang around my brothers. So it's a conflict. Exactly. Pretty good. I only get mad about once a year. Who was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Okay. How do you know them? How close are you to them? Pretty close. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One time I was singing and And I was singing to an audience and that was great. Okay. What are you doing now?

Singing. I'm a singer, so I sing like, Unforgettable. So that's what I like to do. That's great. Have you ever served in the military? No. No. No. Well, that's the hard part. I don't. I don't know. Maybe it's because when I was a kid, my brothers beat me up, And I don't feel totally rested in my cell for my life, so I feel like I don't feel totally safe. Yeah. A little irritable. but I have been sleeping better since I met my girlfriend so it's not totally bad. No way. Behavior, what? I don't know. What have you been doing lately? Tell me about that. and a lot of my stress comes from judging myself and other people. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Yeah, you could say that. How hard is that? Uh, well, I don't know, it's hard to deal with sometimes. I'm sometimes a lot, much too critical for my own good. How do you cope with that? Well, watching TV gets at that. Lately I've just been feeling like I need to have less judgment and more fun. That's good. What made you decide to do that? I did that seminar. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? About a week ago, I think. Tell me more about that. Well, with that seminar I got there and I was able to take off work and be in a different environment because my job is stressful and my life is stressful. So I was able to take a break, which is great. That's good. How would your best friend describe you? fun smart but I'm in LA people in LA they don't want to most of them don't want to spend time with you I don't that's because of me or LA That makes sense.

She is funny and she loves me and cares about me and yeah singer and I'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and I'm a good listener. I've written about four or five books.

337,51,2," All right. So now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll let you know, and I'll give you the doorbell to let you know. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from a suburb of LA, from the San Gabriel Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity. I like the vibe of the city. I've lived other places and it's just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like L.A. Like all the things that are so close together. And there's a lot of interesting things. They're totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. Yeah. I think... What are some things you don't really like about L.A.? I don't like the traffic. I don't like all the cars, but I can live with it. I mean, there's not that much I don't like. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied music, vocal performance. I studied music technology, things like that. Awesome. Are you still working in that? Yes. What do you do now? Right now I sing in an opera company but I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera so I do have a day job. I work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that. It's really good because if I get a call I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig and I do some technology gigs sometimes you know just some recording some live sound stuff but I'm kind of want to get away from that do some video work sometimes but again I want to get away from that I want to go back to the because I find that performing more is more interesting I like being talent more than I like being crew so I kind of want to get away from that side and and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. Okay. Do you consider yourself a caregiver? Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. Because I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people. But if I'm at home, you know, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. Talk to family. Don't really have too many close friends. But yeah, you know. I'd rather keep to myself. How close are you to your family? I'm moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. Thank you. Thank you. But, like, I'm close to my husband. And, you know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt. I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. but it's not like we're interacting every day close together but it's somewhat close mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time, I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. My idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? particularly traveling by car seeing the landscape change seeing people change feeling the vibrations of the area change just seeing what's out there and I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world I like to see that but I like to leave that too and go back to my own world um let's see i think a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we take those we just sort of impromptu with like a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that I like make because I take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but still a world away so because i don't really have time to take like a two-week vacation or whatever but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that i mean because there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway so I like doing that the last time that happened was May of last year so last time I was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am and we kind of grew up like sisters and I was about to move away from the Inland Empire which is where they live so it kind of took me on the last hurrah and we drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while but I didn't like it so they kind of I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time. Things are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean, standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes me really mad, just being cruel or mean for no reason, you know, not for people who can't fight back or people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow either verbally, just cutting them with a quip or I rarely will yell at somebody, but I'll try to walk away and defuse it. work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. Not in like legal trouble or anything because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble but because it is off-putting and it's not the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to the situation I can get out of so as long as they leave me alone you know I'll walk away from it the last time I argued with somebody like per like a per like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my uh the last thing i could think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her she won't go anywhere but la i mean she's like hardcore angeleno like you know we we know we are that we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere but um so we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants because he's a mama's boy like I am I'm a mama's girl even though I've lost my mom like four years ago I'm still a mama's girl and I'll still and I still you know I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much that's what they want so you want to get it for them and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it and you want to do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kind of dangerous for her you know and I don't want something to happen to her yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can because I know a disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24-hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it, you know, amongst ourselves. It's not that bad, but it's getting worse. She really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her and I go back to our house. and it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do, I handle the outside things. I run the errands, I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day-to-day things, make sure she has, she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So, I mean, it's a partnership. It's a, it's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort, but I would like her to move in with us. So that's like a source of, it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. If it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. Yeah. Who's been a positive influence in your life? The most positive influence I think have been probably my mother and my grandmother. Because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence. But were realistic about it. so I mean I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself but they help me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that you know life's going to go on you know my mom would say to me when you're 40 you're 40 whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life and I think that was a big influence and how I've lived my life since she's passed. That's great. Is there anything you regret? I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was in the last year of her life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. my focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right. I didn't take my insulin right. I wanted making myself insulin resistant that year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll and I really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering well if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't completely weren't clouded, would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them. And when she needed me to be, to step in and make decisions for her because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney, she had kidney damage and wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wound up having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wound up having a stroke at like 51. She had a small stroke and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, if I had taken better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death, but would I have been able to make it easier on her if I would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that I have oh I know I am but I it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and I know other people I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be, but I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go. and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to fit into my life in a way, in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings and I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me, but it's still by ideals. So I have to sometimes have to look at it and go, well, is this what I want? because I want it or what is what they want and is it their decision or mine? It's theirs. I know it's theirs. So if you really care about somebody, you're just going to support them and go with them, but it's still kind of hard for me, and I know I've got to get over it. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I wound up taking care of my mother I mean she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and I had a job lined up and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her I think it would have been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her getting my own job history and my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years so I think I probably would have done that um but I told myself just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family. To keep a sense of yourself. That's probably what I would have, and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would have given myself 10 years ago. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know. I mean it's not, I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you give me an example of that? my mother had died it would have been this long battle for a year that we lost and I didn't know if I if I was to blame for that it's like logically I knew I wasn't but how could I convince myself of that um two weeks after she died I wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I figure, oh, I'm 30 years old. If, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over. No, turns out, no. But I wound up having to take more medication because of that. it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden I didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression I'm I almost got divorced because of it because I just didn't want anything anymore so and I was being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and I started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now and it's been a fight and I mean there are times when no I couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died I had four castles like after two were mine two were hers and so I wound up adopting the two that were hers I mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know its own supplies I took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them I mean I could go without eating I could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't they didn't you know so they they actually got me up and made me go out and face things even though I didn't want to didn't just didn't just kind of want to curl up and die but that would have been my choice not theirs and they I mean what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them they would have been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably and maybe they would have not been re-adopted rehomed and adopted by somebody else, maybe they would have been killed for, for me, I mean, for me making selfish decisions, so it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed, and that's actually been a motivating factor is to, because I figured out that it was just me, I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff, I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted, it wouldn't be a big deal I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life but I have a family to look after now so I have to go out and do things you know I have to go out and look for legitimate work you know date you know day job I have to you know but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because there's what I want to do with my life but yet I have to take care of my family so I'm working on a balance of the two how hard is that very, but it's worth it. I mean, it would be very, I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want, you want any if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that and I know that but it gets hard sometimes you do want to give up but then it's like well what's the alternative I mean I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did I wouldn't do anything I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself I'm just going to be content to just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever, and I wouldn't get anything done. How have you been feeling lately? Very anxious and nervous. And, I mean, what if I don't find enough, you know, enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever? what if um you know what if i can't keep a semblance of stability in my life and it's actually hard work to be stable and i know it's hard work to be stable but what you know it's just a lot of what-ifs and another thing it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that but it's still how it's still creeps in so that's actually a source of anxiety when they try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it but i i know it's a cycle and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do just saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take care of here I mean what is just extraneous and what what can what is what are the actual non-issues and what is the actual issue and so figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something will pop up and the what-ifs will come up again I'll have to uh figure it out again but I know it's a cycle I know what seems huge on the surface, when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. When was the last time you felt really happy? The last time I felt really happy? I don't know. like huh good question that actually surprisingly stumped me because I do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kind of in the middle really like over joyously happy I don't know I have not I can't think of when that happened I don't know you don't know perceptions of other people I mean probably as somebody who oddly enough somebody who is laid back and handles things as they come but I don't see myself as that at all. Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done um that and I can do it creatively and I try to strive for balance probably probably the best things about me that's great what are you most proud of in your life then I'm doing basically what I want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not you know I'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to who and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable I mean she's got a career that she it's more of a job that she fell into because my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't want to be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time but her you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um actually my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business so she lost her business and she kind of she retired early because between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early she employed my younger aunt who is still a dog groomer but she hates it and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it and I think the thing I'm most proud of is yeah I'm not as financially well off as she is but I'm doing what I want with my life you know I can be creative I can have creative people around me people who I actually like to talk to around me, people I actually like in my life, and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of, maybe a bloated sense of self-satisfaction to be able to say, I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices, I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. That's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Bye. Goodbye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/337_P/337_AUDIO.wav,0
338,51,2," So I'm just answering questions. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yes. I'm doing fine. I'm from Los Angeles, California. What's your favorite weather? What's your favorite area? What did you study in school? Are you still working on it? I just, I would say yes. What would you do now? Preschool teacher. How did you decide to do that? Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old, so I figured doing something, helping someone, it doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future. What's your dream job? Wow, some job that I could get paid to be outside all day. Get paid well to be outside all day. Yes. I'm kind of quiet but I also like I probably would say borderline. I like outside activities but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself. So yeah, I would say I'm an introvert. Slightly. Oh, wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people. I can't change anyone else's personality, but I can work on my own. I'm pretty good. I usually don't argue with people. I usually walk away. I mean, an argument doesn't settle on anything. Wow. It's a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control. Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. I was extremely close to my mother. That was who I am as a person, who made me as a person. Wow. About 20, 10 years ago, I would tell myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time about things I can't control. I would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself. I think that's pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. No, I have not. No, I have not. Yes. Less than a month. I realize I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't. I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself. I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people. I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before. So I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me. It's not difficult at all. I've always been like a loner, someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. How do you deal with those emotions? A little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point. How do you deal with that? Day by day, day by day. I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution. I've always known, ever since I was a child, things move me differently than other kids. So I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. So, yes. Today I got to see my best friend after a long time. So, I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. Wow, he would say really silly. But still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. wow I mean on certain days everything could be my best quality but I would say um I'm loyal I'm dependable um I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Oh, my mother, by far, my sister. My mom was a schoolteacher, which made me want to become a schoolteacher, and that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. Wow, I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. Wonderful. Wonderful. I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports. And I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. Having such a wonderful mother. I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject because we're introduced into this life and that's our first teacher. That's our first teacher and it's going to be our teacher for a very long time. And I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. Riding my bike, simple things, going for a walk with my sister, exercising. Just last Sunday. Thank you for joining us. Well, thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

339,42,1," Okay. Now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit, and when she sends she'll let you know. I'll put the doorbell over here and you can let me know when she's finished. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and say, you know, I'm a little bit of a person, but I'm not a person. I'm a person. I'm a person. I'm a person. I'm a person. I'm a person. I'm a person. Yes. Yes. I'm okay. I was born in San Bernardino, California. Yes. Where do you live? I'm staying with a sister in North Hollywood. What's it like for you living with them? She makes it as comfortable as possible. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. Mm-hmm. And the entertainment and the public transportation. It's very difficult to find full-time employment. And some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the South. Because I lived in the South before. And those are the only two things. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. What did you study at school? I was an English major in college. Are you still working on that? I haven't finished. Yes, I am. What's your dream job? I'd like to be a recording singer. Really? Yes. What made you decide to do that? I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child. At times. When I'm alone, I am extremely... I guess I would say... inter-minded. Like, I have a lot of thoughts, and I keep them to myself. So, if I'm in that mode, then I don't really interact with people, but I can also interact with people if I change modes. Okay. Okay, Missy. What do you do to relax? I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. And last week on Thursday. No, on Tuesday. Tuesday. usually I just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself that's annoying I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed. Pretty good. I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness, like meeting on time and showing up on time. And it was actually last Monday. No. No. to just be cautious of people's intentions and to listen really well because people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it how would your best friend describe you? A good listener, patient, fun-loving, generous, depressed sometimes, but generally a good person. no I have not yes within a year and a half ago I just knew that I often thought about situations that happened in the past and kind of blame the situation for my future and all um certain settings um if i um see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so I um try to I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now I feel like I um just handle things better as far as um being in the similar settings with similar people I just I handle those things better I do I'd like to believe that it does. I don't worry as much. It's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues um relieves me of the tension of um holding them inside so that's how it's helped me at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um And it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring, if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual, it relieves me of the stress of trying to figure out everything alone. and oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue I was diagnosed with depression and my doctor felt that I should probably see the therapist. Are you happy you did that? I am. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It depends. If I'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do, I often try to plan things, and if I'm planning things, it affects my sleep. I might wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. Irritable. Just very irritable. I was feeling anxious, but now I'm calmer. Do you feel down? Why? Because I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious. Thank you. Yes. Um, maybe in October. When my mother first came, she came to visit me in October. And when she first got here, we had a good time the first couple of days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations. The older I've gotten, the more adaptable I am in different environments and different situations and I've learned how to be more resourceful. So I'm proud of that. Um, I'm sorry. Oh, my dad, my sister, she's positive because she's finished her master's degree. my mom sometimes my best friend is very positive because she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it so that's an inspiration when someone lies consistently I listen very very well sometimes I give good advice I'm a good friend I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do so I'm dependable. I communicate well and I enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Being around positive people, music puts me in a good mood, comedy shows put me in a good mood, good food puts me in a good mood. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When I graduated from high school, it was a really, I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished, and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. Just a little tired. Where are you from originally? California. California? Really? Yes. The weather. Not last week, but yeah, the weather. Fear of earthquakes. Psychology. I am. I go to Harbor College. Are you happy with your job? I am. I wish I would have went sooner, but better late than never. What's your dream job? Probably, I'm not sure. I never really thought about it. I want to work in the field of psychology, but I'm not sure if I want to work with children or adults. So I haven't really decided. Okay. Do you travel a lot? Why? I don't know. I just don't. Maybe once a year. When was the last time you traveled? June, actually. I went to Orlando, Florida. Awesome. Do you consider yourself an expert? Sometimes. Sometimes. But not as, I'm sorry. Watch TV, read a book, talk on the phone. Mad? My mom gets in my business. Other than that, I guess just frustrations with my son. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing is raising a child with a disability, not knowing how you can help him. It is. It's very hard. I don't sugarcoat it at all. What's the best thing about being a parent? Just having my children. They're a blessing. I love them. With all the good and the bad, it's a part of me. And I just love the fact that I'm helping mold them into good human beings. we're really close I mean my family's small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close good or bad most memorable just giving birth for the first time It was just amazing. My son is nine now, so I still remember it like it was yesterday. Like I was being born again myself. I don't know how to explain it. It's just very emotional. I don't know. I guess I have a lot of regrets, but none that I really want to mention, I guess. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay in school. Don't get emotionally involved and let people deter you from your goals. Oh yeah Definitely Did you want me to I'm okay I mean I'm pretty easy going For the most part I don't really have a temper per se Things frustrate me more than they anger me Kind of Oh, that's easy. With my mother, she's like, I guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize. She feels that I'm married with children, so I should stay at home, like 99% of the time. and I wanted to go out and socialize with some ex-co-workers, and she basically kind of put me down for it, as if I don't spend enough time with my children. It does. And I love my mom. I hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because I always think, gosh, I don't want to get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day. But she gets kind of intrusive. I don't know. Oh, I know. After the semester ended when I noted that, you know, I did well in school because I had been, it had been a long time since I went to school. So when I received my grades, you know, A and a B, I was like, wow, okay, I can do this. And it made me happy. And that was about a few weeks ago, I guess. Thank you. My mom. I know, it's good and bad. I mean, for the most part, my mom has been a positive influence. You know, it's just sometimes, you know, she gets a little, like she wants to re-raise me or something. Like, she doesn't understand that I'm an adult and I'm going to make my own decisions now and pretty much have to let me do what I need to do. A lot of heavy breathing. I mean, I walk sometimes when I get a little frustrated or whatever. I'll just go take a walk, you know, or just try not to think about it. Thank you. yes yes the navy i was 19 yeah yes i didn't have any other options i am i probably should have stayed in a little longer i was only in for four years but you know I wanted to experience life outside the military so I did my enlistment and then I got out it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military I could notice a big difference as far as you know how I live my life and how they live theirs just made me a little bit more responsible Thank you. I worked in the medical field for about five years and, oh thank you, but it wasn't for me. I wanted to do something a little bit different. I didn't want to do patient care. I wanted to work with people but not necessarily as a patient care provider. So I started going to school and then I met my husband. I stopped going to school, got married, and I started working in a telecommunications field. And then we, you know, conceived our child. And after that, you know, that's it. I think I'm caring well I know I am I'm very caring you know I'm very honest to a fault sometimes you know I try to be as honest as possible with people sometimes it could hurt their feelings but you know you got to be honest you can't let people think that you know you're not trusting and it yeah probably I never really thought about it I don't know maybe I don't really think about it I just try to be the best person that I can be you know so all I can do I can't live for what other people think I can only do what I need to do I don't know I never really thought about it I guess it's just you know being around my kids you know I just love being around my children that's always puts me in a good mood thank you okay like i said a little tired you know but you know for the most part okay you know i'm dealing with situations different well i go to bed really early so as long as i go to bed early i get a good night's sleep but i wake up early as well so it's kind of like good and bad a little bit i go to bed like 8 8 30 and then i wake up at like 1-130. Very moody. Very irritable. Short tempered, I guess. If anything, I think I'm thinking more positively. You know, like I said, especially with my son having a disability, you know I look at it as if you know it's not all bad I mean he has challenges but I'm dealing with them a lot better you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know I'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it thank you no occasionally who does it I don't know. Can we skip that question? Green. Seems to be the word. Kind of like, yeah, probably green. Like naive a little. But at the same time, smart. I think she'll just grab me as smart. Thank you. Okay. No problem. Bye. Oh, that's right. I got to push the button. It was fine. I kind of skipped one question.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/341_P/341_AUDIO.wav,1

Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Hi. This is Alibaba. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. I'm a student at New York. Yes. Yes. I'm okay. I'm from Los Angeles, California originally. Yes. sunshine the weather is great that's about it smog, pollution, crime certain things like that yeah I did at one point in my life I was in the military I don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more. Seeing different sites, different people. I think it's more the people and being around different types of city and meeting different new people. I traveled to New York one time and it was quite different. city different people that's about it 18 yes I was no I did a lot of combat training but no combat discipline more more motivated you get a lot of things done more even when you don't want to do them you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that that that you really needed to get done but you didn't want to do it but they got there like you had to do a lot of cleaning you had to wake up pretty early, you had to do a lot of PT, you had to stay up to like 2, 3 o'clock in the morning, you didn't wake back up until 4 or 5. To a certain point, yes. After the military, I joined the National Guard and I did 15, 16 years in there. I was excuse me ma'am I didn't quite hear that one what made me decide to do that just the motivation just you know really wanted a career see if I could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit yeah thank you it wasn't that easy I mean, I'm sorry. It was easy. It didn't bother me too much to go back to civilian life. Yeah, it didn't bother me at all. I adjusted pretty well. History, basically a lot. Yeah, just basically history. Are you still working in the office? No, I'm not. I'm disabled. Oh, no, it's okay. It's okay. I can heal. I can get better. Hopefully, I will. Yes, I try to keep up. Excuse me, ma'am. I guess my dream job would probably be working with others, working with young people, Working with kids, seeing that they get the right and proper education that's due to them. So they can be productive in the life of society as we live in today. Yeah. Excuse me. what I think about them I think uh they should be more more uh I mean they should they should participate more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh really achieve something within their lives to give them to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life. Because a lot of them don't get it. When I see people do really, really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing, it really ekes me. I mean, it really bothers me. And when people talk to you, they give you the runaround. It's like, won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the runaround. Won't you just be straight up with me? That can be very frustrating. And when people do really, I'm trying to find the right words, stupid stuff. That really bothers me too. Spraying painting on the wall. Just throwing garbage anywhere. Not picking it up. uh, not really being, uh, you know, not really being hygiene, you know, taking care of yourself and being hygiene, you know what I mean, yeah, when I do, when I'm annoyed, uh, I get really upset, I really start really cussing people out, to be honest with you, and it's something that's not really me, but I'm learning to really let go of it a lot, you know, just, you know, just say, hey, that's the way it is, it's like I'm not in control, I can't control it, yeah, I only have to control the things about what I do, and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good, it's not good for me. How many years can you be in control? Okay, when was the last time you were in control? Yeah. We're real close. I can get along with them. We're real close. I have no problems with them. Yeah. Very good. Just morning. Yeah, I wake up pretty, you know, the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning, I pray. So when my spirit's in connection with the universe and the world, I feel pretty good. Yes. Up and down, you know. up because I'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life and just not doing anything at all. And then other times where you want to get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's roadblocks in the way. But I'm learning how to overcome those roadblocks as well. Well, for instance, looking to go to school and I was having problems getting enrolled in school. I was talking to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and to do it. So I'm like, okay, well, it's going to get done. Yeah. Can you repeat that one more time now? Yes, I have. See, I had to be, I say, for the last couple of weeks, I noticed that I go through certain situations, like you were talking about the anger situation. It's like I don't get angry all the time. That's not me. So sometimes when I get angry, I have to find out what's causing all this, what's causing me to get angry. And I had to take, excuse me now. It's not hard at all. All you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything that you have gone through and take a good look at the situation and then go from there and find out what's really bothering you. it's very seldom uh i suffer from ptsd and uh getting that type of sleep would be would be great because i have recurring nightmares so of an incident so So I think it is, and I don't know what it's triggered by, but I think it is, and that's why I'm talking to someone or seeing someone because I'm a veteran at the VA about the situation now, about the PTSD basically right now. Excuse me, ma'am. a lot of nightmares, a lot of problems, a lot of anger issues, depression. I noticed all this in me, and I just started to tell myself I needed help. And that's basically it. I just, you know, I just, you know, something wasn't wrong with me. Something wasn't right with me. So when something's not right with me, I have to take time out to just, you know, take a good look at myself and ask myself, if something's right, then that's fine. If something's not right, then you need to take care of it. And I just start seeking help down there, yeah. somewhat yes it is somewhat because i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh telling my situation and we usually would go over the problem and uh i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit yeah it's a good thing excuse me no no not really my best friend uh they he will describe me as a fun loving good person always there I try to help others, think more of others really than more of myself. But when I know I need things that need to be done for me, I take care of it. So, you know, and they really, actually they really look up to me. They have a lot more respect for me. Yeah, they see something in me they wish that they had. Excuse me, ma'am. Can you be a little bit more specific? Let's see now. Okay. What are you doing? Books, crossword puzzles, walking. That's about it. Okay. What are you doing? I thought I did, but I don't think I do. I don't think I regret anything because this is how it is. This is the way it is for me. So I accept it and I keep moving on. Because if I regret anything in the past, then I'm wasting my time on that because it's gone. That's the past. I need to move on. I need to live in the present so I can be prepared for the future, so I can move on to the future. Yeah. More education, being more direct and more confident in what I'm doing like I am today. So yeah, that's what I was lacking maybe 20 years ago. Yes, I have had a lot of positive people been in my life. Yes, some people would consistently motivate me to continue and pursue a certain goal. and I thought that was pretty good because I really don't see that a lot. And it gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things because anything that you do, it's a choice. It's up to you whether or not if you do it or not. That choice is still up to you for it to be done. Excuse me, ma'am. then I'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished that I thought I couldn't. But it can be accomplished if I'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it. oh wow huh oh really and you know what I really enjoy was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life and school was one of them uh and just being just school was one of them and I kind of liked it that because that was the first time Simone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me. Yeah, and I thought that was a great thing. So as long as you're willing to do that, I'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school. And yeah, that's what gets me going. Oh, it is, and I love it, and this is going to be accomplished. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Yeah, I think she's through. Jack, I thought she was really human. Wow. Boy, technology. I know.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/344_P/344_AUDIO.wav,2

Um, just, you know, thinking too much. Um, I don't know. Um, I think just, uh, stress, you know, a lot of stress every day, just everyday stress. Uh, yeah, pretty much that's what triggers it. um I just try to stay positive I try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better um I just I try to call somebody and talk to them if I have trouble like my grandma yeah thanks when I don't sleep well um well I start to like cry a lot and I start to get really irritable um I get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all I get very uh it just is really, really bad if I don't get sleep, yeah, yeah, thanks. Yes. I was diagnosed, um, three years ago. Uh, I just, I didn't really know what was going on, and I realized, okay, well, they just diagnosed that and um I was like okay well this is the problem and it I just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that it's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that yeah yeah it's hard um yeah yeah I definitely always thought I had a problem I always thought something was like really wrong um I just always like kind of nervous around people Like I never can really like look anybody in the eye because I'm just so nervous. My eyes are always kind of like racing and I would have sweats if I was in the situation that reminded me of the situation. Like I just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks. Yeah. Oh, I I've been feeling good. I've been getting out more every day. I'm trying to, um, I guess walking keeps my mind off my PTSD symptoms, so I'm trying to walk more. That helps. That's good. Thanks. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Um, yeah, I have depression. Um, yeah. Okay. Is going to therapy helping you? Um, it helps. Yeah, it actually does help me a lot. Um, I currently don't have one right now. I'm actually getting a new one in a few days though. Like it's kind of a mix up, but yeah, it really, really helps me. Um, I noticed that I've had less flashbacks and, um, I've been more relaxed, I guess. And, um, yeah, just, you know, trying to keep more occupied. Yeah, it helps. That's good. When was the last time you felt really happy? What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm trying to think of what I'm most proud of. Um, I think I'm most proud of like the fact that I am able to, you know, not be like, oh, I mean, most people I know, they like deny that they have a problem. and I'm proud that I can actually, like, you know, be a person who can realize, okay, I have a problem and I need help. But a lot of the people I know, they don't take medication, they're untreated, and they just don't want to get any help. And I'm glad to get help because I don't want to feel that way and I want to get help for the problem instead of feel that. That's good. Is there anything you regret? Oh, gosh, there's a lot I regret. Yeah, there's a lot. I regret, you know, drug abuse, you know, but that's part of, you know, the PTSD. I regret a lot, mistakes, you know, relationships, stuff like that. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wow. I would have told myself to, I guess the advice I would have given myself was to try to keep my mind more relaxed, I guess. Yeah. What would you say is the most fun? Well, I'm a very nice person and I always like to smile. People are always saying how I smile a lot, but the smile, I guess it kind of hides what's on the inside, but I'm pretty depressed, but I just try to keep smiling, and I always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better. Okay. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun? I like to go to the mall. That's a lot of fun. I like to go to the mall.

346,85,2," Okay. So now I'm going to start up a virtual human and she's going to chat with you for a bit. Okay. When she's done, she'll let you know. She'll say bye. Okay. And I'm going to give you the doorbell again and you can ring that one. Okay. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to call me. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Here in Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? There's a lot of things to do. I love the beach. I love that it's sunny all the time. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The amount of people. That's really about it, the amount of people. Just a little. I just like going to new places and just discovering new things. I recently went to New York. I was there for about three months. It was extremely boring. I went to Western New York and it was extremely snowy and I wasn't in a position where I didn't have a car so I didn't get to go very many places and I was in a small town. So it was beautiful for what I got to see but really there wasn't really much to it. Yeah. Both, I'm both an introvert and an extrovert. Tell me more about that. I really enjoy doing things by myself. I have a lot of my own, my likes and dislikes. I spend a lot of time alone, even though I do have a lot of friends. and when I do go out I do tend to meet a lot of people but I also enjoy being by myself a lot. Probably outgoing, creative, talented, fun, trustworthy. I studied language and physics and math. Are you still working on that? No, I'm not. I'm actually, I'm trying to be an actress. How did you decide to do that? It was something that I fell into when I was a teenager. And I really enjoyed doing it and I hadn't done it for years. So I figured, why not? I just came back to California and I might as well try something that I did enjoy really doing. So far, I just got picked up by an agent. So I haven't really done anything yet as an adult, but I'm hoping something, it'll be fruitful. I really don't have too many I guess my sister she's done really well my boyfriend he's a very positive human being but But really I haven't had too many positive influences. I'm close. I mean, we hang out. I don't tell them everything. They're kind of judgmental. But other than that, I mean, we hang out. I mean, I see them every day. Um, geez. Um, it's kind of hard for me to relax. Um, I mean, I try to watch TV. Um, and I read a lot. Um, that's probably about it. I read, I do a lot of sleeping. I'm a little depressed. So, um, yeah, it's kind of, like I said, it's really hard for me to relax. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Are you triggered by something? Um, I dream a lot about, um, the stuff that has, uh, has affected me throughout the years. So, um, it's usually, you know, like I'll dream about something that stressed me out and then I'll wake up and my, my chest will hurt. Um, or just, I just can't sleep all night because I just think, I seem to be, I don't know if I'm afraid to go to sleep, but I, I just, I don't know. I feel like that's a vulnerable place for me because of stuff that have happened to me. So sleeping is just not really something I do well. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I'm moody. I'm very sensitive. I'm just a negative person which really that's not me I yeah judgmental is not me either I'm just not a nice person to be around How do you cope with that? I try I spend a lot of my time reading I try to go out and do, I force myself to go out and do things just to keep myself involved so that I don't just sit around and dwell on the fact that I can't sleep. And I try to get myself as exhausted as I possibly can by running around and doing things. How hard is it? It's difficult. I do like there is a part of me that doesn't want to I don't really want to go out and do things I have to actually force myself to if I have make appointments I make appointments to like for auditions or even to do this I am I tend to just not like at the last minute I'll try to convince myself not to go but then I force myself to anyways Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I've been diagnosed for two instances. I was diagnosed about three and a half years ago and then I was diagnosed again in August. What part were you diagnosed? the first time it was, um, I just wasn't, because of the not sleeping, um, and the, uh, just this, the unbelievable stress, um, and then the second time it was, once again, I started with the not sleeping, um, and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me, and I just couldn't take it anymore. So I figured I was getting too gloomy. I was getting like not thinking life was worth it and I just needed to see somebody before anything escalated. Yeah, it was. I do not. one of the reasons I went to New York was to try to get out of my environment and and that seemed to help a lot and out here I was I just the counselors that I was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much they just they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and I don't believe that that's what I needed. Yeah, so, yeah. Stressed. Lately I've been really sad and I don't know why, but like I said, I've been trying to combat that by keeping myself busy. Um, actually, um, I'm kind of, a couple days ago, I was actually really happy, and it was genuinely happy, um, but then it went back to being, you know, going back to feeling miserable, so. Can you tell me about that? Well, I realized I got up in the morning I actually did get a good night of sleep And I realized that I'm actually really lucky Because I've been through a lot in my life And I have somebody in my life who really loves me And somebody who is finally there for me And You know, gives me what I need emotionally and I was just really thankful for that and that made me really happy. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, geez. I've had so many years of just bad, just a lot of bad, that it there has it's been a long time since I've been proud of anything I guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships I've been through um a lesser person I guess would have gotten rid of themselves a long time ago but um even though like I'm really depressed and I feel gloomy and I just feel miserable about a lot of things um there's got to be a silver lining. So, um, so yeah. So I mean, like, I guess that's what I'm proud of that. Although a whole bunch of bad things happened to me, it hasn't ruined me. I still try to be a good person. Um, I, I turn out to be negative towards other people and, um, and truthful and I still, I still have drive in me. Yeah. So much. My last marriage. Not getting out when I should have. And just... I regret a lot. Um, that any situation that would have had a red flag, um, just get out of it, you know. Some things just don't work. And, um, no matter how hard you try, no matter how much you put into it. So, um, I, I would tell myself, um, to, um, that it's not selfish to let go of a bad situation. And, um, not everybody can be helped. so sometimes you just got to live for yourself and help yourself so had I known that then had I known that then I I probably would have done better in life so yeah um people who um when people are down on me for my faults Um, that I have done, that I, things that I have done in my past that people still, still relive when I'm trying to forgive myself. Um, people who are mean to other people. Uh, people who talk poorly about people behind their backs. People that are untrustworthy. Um, just anybody who picks on the little guy. Um, you know, people who don't care about the environment or animals. I think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be and it's disheartening and it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do and that makes me mad I vent yeah I tend to vent and then and then it's usually over I try not to bad mouth people I try to just talk through it until until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore I try not to get angry because I have a really bad temper and it can get out of hand. So what I do is if something gets me so mad, I tend to go and take a nap. If I'm not in that situation where I can just go and take a nap, I usually just walk away from the situation and I try to clear my mind and come back to it. Okay. When was the last time you had a relationship? When was it at all? It was a couple days ago, it was actually with my mother. It was about, actually she thought that I had taken a shirt from her and she was screaming and yelling at me and I was tired. I was late and I started to yell back at her because I was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty and it's going back to my past you know when I was younger and you know I didn't care about you know people's things and I would just kind of take and do whatever I wanted to and I'm not so far from that person and it hurt me so I got mad and And I started to yell and argue. Kind of petty and stupid, but at the time it seemed viable. What were your most memorable experiences? Hmm. One of my most memorable experiences. I've had so many. Maybe it was, I don't know. It was probably graduating pharmacy school. That's great. How did you feel in that moment? I felt pretty great. I didn't know if I was doing very well or not. And I ended up getting, like on my last test scores, I ended up getting like 98% and I actually had no confidence that I had done it well in class and school at all and I didn't even know how I was getting the grades I was getting. So that was a really big accomplishment for me and yeah, that was a great, it was a great memory, yeah. Awesome. Yeah. What would you say is the most troubling? I'm reliable. I'm talented. I'm a good listener. I'm always there to help people. I tend to always try to do the right thing sometimes actually I forget that I have any good qualities but I'm just I all around I try to be as good and the best person that I can be to other people and myself going to comedy shows just having moments where you just laugh with people sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood I don't know probably that's about it thank you bye Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/346_P/346_AUDIO.wav,2

I used to exercise. I used to do a lot of things. Lately, I find it hard to relax. I don't have the same outlets that I did before. I don't pursue them as much anymore.

Even more distracted and even more lackluster, lackluster had a best friend uh... maybe a lot of positive as just before but now just you know just uh some people say i should be proud because i'm surviving a hard time or some people think that i'm a loser so i don't know maybe um a survivor um persistent What are you most proud of in your life? right anymore to be quite honest. I don't know. Psychology. Well, initially, yeah. No, not really per se, although my current career involves a lot of psychology and a lot of the aspects I don't know what I'm trying to say um it's a bit's a part of it but it's not the center of it well I guess if my career is still going I'm in nursing but I've been sick lately and with depression and other health care problems, I have found it necessary to apply for disability, Social Security income, and I'm starting the process of that because I'm not working. How hard is that? Very. What's your dream job? Educating people, making a difference. I mean, I've had my dream jobs. I've had my dream jobs. I don't know what the future will hold for work, but something I suppose working with people again. Helping in some way. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No, but lately with the depression more so at times. Is there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me. of me but I just wish there were times then that the choices that I would have were better because some choices that I seem to have made or were made for me have made my world kind of shitty for lack of a better word shitty. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong, to believe in myself, to remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too, to get up off my ass and move to, um, to have confidence, faith. Um, I just, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. I just, uh, it seems like when I've tried to make my world better, I just keep getting knocked down so it's almost like I'm I don't want to give up but every time I try and move forward I get knocked back and it's it's exhausting and I don't have any support system really nobody loyal, hardworking, dependable, capable, intelligent, contemplative, deep, not a superficial person. Yeah, I guess those are some of the... When was the last time you felt really happy? Many years ago. Can you tell me about that? I used to have a lot of confidence. I used to be a pretty dynamic person. I used to be, people used to say that I was the most centered person that they knew. And I used to help people. And I'm now in their shoes and I don't seem to be able to help myself. I can't think of anything right now I can't think of really anything right now. What are some things you like to do for fun? I don't do much anything for fun anymore. I used to, however, go to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends, do things. But lately I don't really have any pursuits. a good day, a happy day a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong basically yeah bye Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/349_P/349_AUDIO.wav,1

She's going to chat with you for a bit. Okay. And then she'll say goodbye. She'll let you know when you're all through. Okay. And then I'm going to put the doorbell back over here and you can let me know when you're done. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. I'm going to start with a virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk to people in the same sense as your environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are totally confident. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine, thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? Originally I'm from, well I was born in Mississippi, so I'm from Gulfport, Mississippi. Really? Yes. Why did you miss LA? I didn't have a choice. I was a child. I moved here with my parents. Aww. When did you miss LA? When I was two years old. You were very young, weren't you? Yes, I was. I was a toddler. Did you travel a lot? Yes, I like to travel and I travel a lot. What do you enjoy about traveling? Being around new environments and new people, different things. I'd love to go on a trip. Well, one of my favorite trips was visiting Africa. In, I think, 2006, I visited West Africa. That was a great trip for me. me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people. Wow, how did you decide to do that? A friend of mine was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so I went with her and it went from there so I don't know I made the decision that way. Are you happy you did that? I am, I am happy I did that it's something I'll never forget. That's so good to hear. What did you study at school? I studied English and education so that I could teach high school students. Are you still working in that? Not currently, no. What do you do now? Well, right now I tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher. What's your dream job? job? Well, anything that combines teaching, traveling, and writing would be a dream job for me. So yeah, anything that combines those three items. So teaching has the closest outcome to that. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Um, occasionally, yes. Why? Um, I don't know. I guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing, and a lot of people have said I seem reserved or kind of introverted. I don't know. Okay. What do you do to relax? Well, I don't know. I read. I just started meditation. I try to breathe and calm down. Yeah. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Some things that make me really mad? mistreatment of children abuse of children try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there if I can control not being annoyed like ultimately I control that whether or not I'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed if I can help it at all. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, I'm fine at controlling my temper. I think so. I don't have, yeah. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? The last time I argued with someone was, I don't know, maybe a couple of days ago, and it was about it was about a smell they had on their clothes that I thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so yeah this is cool how close are you to your family? I think I'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day see each other most every day that's great There's been a lot of positive influences in my life. I would say my aunt and definitely my mother have all been positive influences. Tell me more about that. Well, I look up to my aunt. I think she's positive. I look up to her because obviously We grew up with very similar backgrounds, came from very similar neighborhoods and areas, and she's very successful despite the types of things that we've gone through as children. And she doesn't let her past define her future. My mom's overcome so many obstacles as well. She has some challenges with her health, but she still tries to be optimistic, and she still tries to, you know, overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have. So I look up to people who are able to, you know, not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible. Yeah. That's great. Have you ever served in the military? No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I have. How long ago were you diagnosed? Well, I was diagnosed within the last year, and then again most recently within the last three months. What got you into this? Well, fear and just not knowing what to do with some of the things I was feeling and not knowing why I couldn't stop feeling the way I was feeling. What were your symptoms? There were a lot of symptoms. Mostly, I gained a lot of weight. I couldn't sleep a lot. And then sometimes I could sleep too much. felt sad sometimes like I wanted to cry a lot I'm feeling okay um their days you have I don't know every day is different so I mean today I feel fine but like I said everything's differently and lately I've been feeling more like I can be involved in my own life and like I want to get out and do more things. No, no, no, no, not any different from before what I was experiencing before. No. Well, I was receiving, I guess, psychotherapy, and I don't know, a lot of things happened. I moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother, and I just kind of got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while. That sounds really hard. Sometimes. Do you feel like there's a reason? I do. Yes, it is. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's kind of difficult. I either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep. Are you trying to figure it out? I'm sure it is. I just don't know what it is as of yet because I, you know, usually it's thoughts, continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep. Journal sometimes. That might help if I can write some things down and get it out. That helps. Other than that, I don't, you know, haven't found any really great ways of coping. Tired. yeah mostly uh tired um kind of confused okay when was the last time you felt really happy i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays I'd love to hear all about it. I don't know. I guess just being around family and friends, just the holiday season, I guess, in general. That's just a happy time for me. And seeing people I haven't seen in a while. That's about it. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? How would my best friend describe me? probably as quiet sometimes, cautious, talkative sometimes, tenacious. I don't know. A lot of my friends say that they look up to me for some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because I'm caring and compassionate or easy to talk to, that I remind them of or feel like a sister to them. Oh, that's great. Is there anything you regret? Everyone has regrets, I'm sure. Yeah, I guess so. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? to just relax and be yourself and just go ahead. And it sounds cliche, and I don't mean to sound that way, but it's true. It's just you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time. It doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it. It just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their time and their progression to how they get to things. So I would tell me 10 years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that I want for my life. And don't be, yeah. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I really enjoyed working with, well, okay, a science project with my younger relatives, my cousins. We did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made. It was a ball. Awesome. What are you most proud of in life? the first to attend college in my family and then going to college and coming back to the community where I went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping youth or children that come from the same background that I came from. So I'm most proud of being able to have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themselves as well. That sounds like a great situation. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye. I guess I'll press this. Hi! That is really cool.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/350_P/350_AUDIO.wav,0
351,46,2," Okay. I'm going to fix my hair. Great. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Yes. Okay. Okay. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? Why did you go to LA? To pursue a music industry, a job in the music industry. Are you still working in that? Yes. What do you do now? I'm self-employed. What's your dream job? To become a music producer. Awesome. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. There's a lot of competition. Why did you move to LA? To pursue a job. When did you move to LA? When? About a year ago, last February. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty difficult. The East Coast is a lot different than the West Coast. How often do you go back to your hometown? I think I've been there twice in the past year That's good Do you travel a lot? No, I'm more of a creature of habit Okay Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes Why? Sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd So it's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of, you know, going in and actively pursue things. Probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs. Probably people being not very nice to me or seeing injustices or I think that's about it. Pretty good. you know um probably a couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that yeah it does pretty close um my best friend so i um i'm just one of my friends um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually How hard is that? It's pretty hard. I'd rather the person notice that I'm kind of getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like, it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Probably spending time with my family. in New York. How close are you to your family? Very close. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? My sister and my brother. Tell me more about that. I don't know. They're just great people, and I love them a lot, and they're a lot like me, so I feel like I have people that understand me. That's good. How would your best friend describe you? Probably, I guess, loyal, sensitive. I don't know. It's kind of hard. It's a hard question. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Gosh, I think probably 1997, so a long time ago. What got you to see a doctor? I'm just, during that time I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself, so I ended up going to the doctor. to kind of get meds and have therapy and stuff. Do you still go to therapy now? Not currently. I ended about like six months ago. Why did you stop? I just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me. I felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over, and she wasn't really challenging me. And I've been in therapy for a really long time, so I just knew it was a change. that's okay um yes I do actually um when I feel connected to a therapist um and I feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what I'm going through um so yes I do What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the career path? not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know they tell me it's okay basically um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things I used to like had a little bit of concentration issues having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. Are you triggered by something? Sometimes they are, like random moments, if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if I sometimes even seeing something on television, like sometimes that affects me. How do you feel about that? listening to music or trying to distract myself, trying, like my therapist told me, for the longest time to journal, to record things. It's been a tough transition to come here, so, well, being here. So kind of half and half, okay and not okay. I feel like I've been a little bit more withdrawn lately, but that's about it. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Some days it's great, some days it's not. More recently, it's been a little bit more difficult. Why? I don't know why. I have a lot of thoughts on my mind at night, so I tend not to sleep very well. and I wake up quite frequently during the night. Very groggy in the morning, and that's about it. Like, during the day, I tend to yawn a lot, and my friends always are like, why are you yawning so much? Are you disinterested in what we're doing? And I'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. Probably Christmas time. when I was with my family. How did you feel about that moment? How did you feel about that moment? Um, just really happy and, um, feeling like everything was all right in my life. Having a good sense of, like, where I was at that moment. Being present with myself. That's good. What would you say are some of the best qualities? um probably you know um let's see it's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kind of well sometimes and um i like to say i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when I do have a job so um um sure I mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um I wish that I don't eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy um don't take things so seriously um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it I don't know that's a good question probably my previous job and my employment I worked really well with kids so I did a great job at that I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years yeah it was awesome um I was really inclined of like um reading people and so I decided to major in psychology so um and then I went and worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them With drugs and depression and things like that. So it found like a good niche for me. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. No problem. Goodbye. Goodbye.

352,35,1," Thank you. Yes. I'm doing pretty good. I'm from Oklahoma. Oklahoma. Yep. Oklahoma City. Ah, the weather is great. I love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains. I just love it here. It was pretty easy. There's a few differences. It's a huge city compared to where I'm from, so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me. I just always wanted to live in California. Hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the West Coast, be near the ocean. I studied psychology and minored in art. No, not at the moment. Well, actually, I think I misunderstood your question. I'm not still working on my degree, but I am working in the field of psychology. I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law. My dream job? Oh, I don't really know. I think I just want to help people however I can, and I just like working with people in the realm of psychology, so I think I may already have my dream job. To relax, I like to read or watch movies. I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends. Things that make me really mad, probably injustice towards other people, people being mistreated or abused. and people being lied to and deceived, including myself. I hate being lied to. When I'm annoyed, it depends on the situation, but I try to just count to ten and take a deep breath and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way, so I just try and calm down before I say anything. How many times do you get angry? When was the last time you argued with someone? It was probably with my parents. I've been having some car trouble lately, and I'm also running low on money, so I'm sure, I don't even remember exactly, but I'm sure we kind of probably thought about the fact that I, you know, need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues. I'm very close with my family. they're still in Oklahoma but I talk to them on the phone all the time oh definitely I mean my mom I think um she's probably the person that I'm closest to and she just she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and I just want to be like her in those ways oh probably the time I went bungee jumping over the Nile River in Uganda um I still kind of have flashbacks of that moment just free falling it was like the coolest experience ever and I love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time yeah well I have I have traveled a lot nowadays I don't travel so much anymore but I used to work for a cruise line Norwegian cruise line so I would go travel all the time with them and then I also did an 11 month long trip around the world it was a mission trip so I just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool I just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity in the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool. No, I have not served in the military. Nope. No, I've never been formally diagnosed, although I would say I probably diagnosed myself with depression. Just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years, I'm probably 99% sure that I've struggled with depression off and on. So yeah. Lately, it's been pretty easy. But throughout the years, I've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia, just like either not being able to fall asleep, or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now I'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me I'm not a pleasant person when I don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me I think maybe more so than a lot of people I I like need good sleep to function I've been feeling really good um over the past several months I was unemployed after coming out here and that was really really tough um and I just recently got offered my job just like last week so I definitely think I've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has lifted off of me because I don't have that pressure any longer of like how am I going to make ends meet this city is really expensive and I don't have a job and so I feel I feel much more relieved than I have been feeling which is good um yeah well I mean just like I said over the past week or so I've become a lot more positive I was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like I said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell I guess and that was kind of how it was how it's been for me and just since I got offered the job I just have so much more confidence and like positivity that things are are starting to work out for me which is good. oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually I went um I went to explore part of the South Bay area that I hadn't really been to before and it was I was just going to go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful And then I went for a drive up kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that I'd never seen before. And I just like was overwhelmed how pretty it was. And I was just like, oh, I can't believe that I get to live here. So that was definitely a happy moment for me. My best friend would probably say that I'm very daring and bold and fearless. That I'm unique and artistic. And I don't, I would guess I should probably say that I'm a nonconformist. I don't really think the way that a lot of people do and I question everything, which can be a good or bad thing. But yeah. Probably just like the fact that I really try to live my life with like no regrets and just I try to live a very exciting life in a way and I think that especially ever since I finished college and have been traveling like I have and I've tried moving all different places by myself so I think just the fact that I I'm not really afraid I don't let things hold me back I just if I want something or if I want to do something I just do it and I guess in a way like I like that about myself and the fact that I'm really independent and can just go and do whatever I feel like doing even if it's hard I still I'm proud that I've overcome a lot of those struggles oh there's like minor things that I regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major because I think pretty much everything that I've done I've learned from whether it's good or bad so I wouldn't really change anything oh I would say I would tell myself when I was a kid that I should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because um I guess as I've grown into an adult I've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and then if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it and so I would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you want to do oh let's see that's kind of hard um oh I guess I went home recently for Christmas back to Oklahoma and I got to see some of my friends from college that I hadn't seen and some of them I hadn't seen in like since I graduated so which has been like four years ago so it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun. Cool. You're welcome. Bye. Yay! It worked. Okay. That was fun. So I'm going to... Could she stay up in the cafe during the other time?",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/352_P/352_AUDIO.wav,0
353,55,2," Thank you. Yes. I'm okay. Okay. Pennsylvania. you? Well, I was in Boston for a couple years and then I moved here about three and a half years ago, but I just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life. Maybe once or twice. Last year I only got to go back once a year. Definitely safer and definitely a more well I dismiss it because I have a lot of family back there but LA is okay, I mean everyone loves the climate here not too easy, I have two really good friends here and I have a boyfriend I've been with for three years so that helps, he's from here but it definitely took a bit of adjustment no advertising communications no I'm currently working and actually I'm not working right now at the moment I want to be a naturopathic physician so basically versus western medicine a naturopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise just a variety of things to actually get someone to live a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine How did you get into the degree? Well, one of the great things was when I came out here to LA, I was exposed to the degree which I had never heard of living on the East Coast. Do you have any friends who are from the East Coast? Sometimes. Why? Well, I'm very particular about the people I like to surround myself with. And I don't like to socialize with a lot of people. I mean I tend to like small intimate groups and I don't tend to like to be in larger, bigger groups. Um, when people don't take into account other people's feelings. I usually try to go for a walk if I get very irritated. I'm usually really good. It really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset. Let's see. um I was up with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case yeah it was he's I don't know I think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers I have no idea I'm very trustworthy I'm loyal I care very deeply so I like to try to help other people and I always like to try to cheer people up so I think that would be some of them No Yes Just a few months ago about in the last six months I was experiencing mental issues that I never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and I knew that it wasn't I knew that it wasn't that I couldn't overcome it by myself a lot better I've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation kind of seeing things from a different purview or not not purview but a different view and um that's helped but there's definitely times where I kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working um I think I you know I have a difficulty being in public um I'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happens so I'm not that comfortable going out during the day I tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um I don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out? Um, well, I've been gradually trying to increase how much I'm outside. Um, and I usually just deep breathing. Um, I do a lot of breathing exercises and I just try to say that basically what I'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real. And that I just, I try. I just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually. A lot better since the last couple months, but before I very much, pretty much stayed home. It's been good. it's been good to hear someone's feedback but I feel like I've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling I do well I feel more like myself which is a huge improvement and I am more cautious and regarded in some ways about my thoughts and about my decisions as well. I'm not so, oh, you know, I'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that I want in my life. It's gotten better. I'm better now the first three months it was very difficult I couldn't sleep through the night and I woke up maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now I am sleeping through the night again I feel groggy I feel foggy and out of it and just low kind of depressed I think it's been a while um working I'm a bit of a workaholic spending time with my family yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading very close what is that? um um well my parents because they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what I'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own decisions my own choices in life and then my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me I'm the baby I'm the youngest in the family so they always um looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend shoots me with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when I'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or run an errand without having a lot of anxiety. I'm most proud of the jobs, the work that I've done, the people I've helped. maybe that I took this job where I was assaulted at that would be it going into retail into this unsafe environment not listening to my gut what advice would I what to recklessly pursue your dreams that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted Let's see...

Not really. What did you study at school? I studied architecture and Chicano studies and a little bit of history. That sounds interesting. What made you decide to do that? Since I was little, I liked to draw and I liked to learn about history. Cool. Are you still working in that? I'm trying to. I'm working and going to school. I'm trying to finish getting my degree. What's your dream job? Playing in the NFL. Awesome. What was that? I don't know what that is. Eat or sleep? People not doing their jobs. Walk away. Um, pretty good. Like, three days ago, a couple days ago, over some family issues. Um, sure. What are some things you like to do for fun? I like to work out, play football, and ride my bike. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Walking on that UCLA. How did you feel in that moment? I felt big, like, actually I was doing something with myself. That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My parents. Tell me more about that. Like, they struggle. Whenever they struggle, they still manage to pull through whatever they want.

No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty hard. Why? I get home late and I'm usually up for like 15 to like 18 hours during the day. So by the time I get home, I'm really not even that tired to go to sleep. Yeah. If I don't sleep well, I wake up grumpy or not in the mood to do things. Just like under pressure a little bit. How hard is that? Not that hard. I just stress pretty much. Do you feel down? Sometimes. Why? Just working. I really don't like working, but I have to. Yeah, I see what you mean.

355,45,2," Thanks. I have a few questions for you, sir. I'm curious to know if you're going to start living on your own. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? All right. That's good. Where are you from and where are you from? I was born in Los Angeles, California. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? Well, the weather and the fact that people aren't so obtrusive like on the East Coast. What are some things you don't really like about the East Coast? Just the traffic and the smoggy weather. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I'm unemployed now, so I rarely go anywhere. Okay. What did you study at school? I have a BS in business with a computer option. How did you decide to do that? I thought that the only place I could get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods. So I took that. I took the business computer methods option. What's your dream job? What are some things you like to do at home? I like to travel, but like I said, I don't have money for that anymore. That's all right. What are some things that you do? People who are chicken heads, they get their nose in other people's business, even if they're just strangers. You expect that from a family member or a friend, but, you know, especially with the Internet, that feeds a lot of that now. We know what Orwell was referring to when he spoke of Big Brother in 1984. What do you do when you're in law? I don't do much different than I would otherwise. How long do you do it in front of your friends? I've had many temper outbursts. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone you didn't know? I kind of argue with my aunt. And it was because she was basically making leading statements, trying to trap me into saying something about a relative. And it annoyed me greatly. What place are you with your family? I'm kind of on the outs with my parents. Why? I'm kind of the black sheep. I understand. Who's done what's been a positive influence on you? Tell me more about that. Ozzy Stills and Ashton Young concert at the Forum. And she has seven kids, and she picked me up at the Sizzlers right across the street from the Forum at 11 o'clock at night. And I couldn't imagine, with all she had to do that day, that she agreed to do that, but she did. Wow. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh, probably going down to the cape at the end of the Valhalla Peninsula in Cabo San Lucas, or photographing the Bridal Veil Falls in Yosemite. How did you feel when you saw that? It was probably the two most majestic sea sights I've ever seen. That's not like a great experience for you. It was when I could afford to travel. No. No. I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011. And I took some Lexapro, but I stopped after one day. I didn't want to do it anymore. No. Because I didn't feel it was helpful. I feel I was becoming a zombie. Yeah. I'm depressed about not having a job for over two years. I lost my job in October 2010, and except for jobs like this, which I'm fortunate to get, just, you know, daily things, focus groups like that, I haven't worked. Thank you. Especially when you're 56 years old. Well, it's just a general feeling of hopelessness. I get out on my bicycle a lot. I walk or bike four hours a day. About two hours each. Yeah. Very easy. Because now I'm old. When I was young I couldn't sleep more than four or six hours a night. Because I'm restless. No. But now that I'm old, I sleep much more easily. I pray before I go to sleep. And that's when I can't have any trouble sleeping. I just pray. Recite different prayers like the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary, stuff like that. And I'm able to fall off to sleep. I don't know, probably, I can't have any specific remembrances of that. You know, it was when I had money to spend, I know that, and when I had to have a job to have money to spend, so it was probably 15 years ago. Tell me about something you never even knew you were going to do. Well, I haven't really enjoyed anything. Last week I made $75 on a job with the county. Basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise. They were running for their personnel, and they enlisted people to play basically the relatives of people who had been in a bombing at the Staples Center. And we, you know, asked questions, signed up, you know, told them, gave them information on our missing, you know, relatives. And basically it was provided by the county. And basically went through a routine in downtown L.A. How hard was it? Not hard. It was just a routine we had to follow. but we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics, height, weight, etc. How are your best friends? I don't have a best friend. What would you say is your best friend? I'm very bright. I'm a perfectionist at my job. I'd say that's about it. I got a business degree, and I've never been a motivated person. I went to school. I went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet that end. So I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my, you know, to my, I guess, self-esteem, you might say. So I had something to hang on the wall. Yeah, I regret, you know, alienating family members. I would have basically not been so impetuous and left jobs thinking that, you know, I could always get another one and not, you know, basically blow off jobs. I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now. They've added locations, but I've burned bridges there, so that's not possible. Okay, I think I've answered everything you asked me. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hasta luego. Oh.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/355_P/355_AUDIO.wav,1
356,48,2," Now I'm going to pull her up and if you let me know, if you can see her just fine without your glasses, then we recommend you take them off, but if you need them to see her, you are welcome to keep them on. But we want you to see her face and everything, so if it's more probably you can take your glasses off. You know, I think from this distance I think I better... Yeah, sure, of course. Okay, great. So here is your doorbell. Of course. Okay, great. So here is the doorbell. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people and say things that they're tired of. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confident. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? From here, from Alhambra. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads, too much traffic. Yeah, I see what you mean. What did you study at school? I studied art and photography. That sounds amazing. How did you decide to do that? It was so much a decision, I just kept noticing that I was very interested in it. Cool. Are you still working on that? Yes. I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No, not, no. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. tied down. It's fair, it's not the greatest because of being a department manager I do have free rent but I have to stay there a lot. That part does, the free rent part is very good. Oh gosh, my most memorable experience. It's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. Oh, well I guess some like sports success when I was in high school. There was a few things that I was happy about and some art pieces I've made were memorable. Some bad things would be my father's death, but those were very memorable, not good though. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters, so my family. How close are you to your family? Fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. What do you think of Cindy's kids? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And I think they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. It seems like they were all hooked into social media. Yeah. I'm using them. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. What do you do instead of doing that? Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. And not big deals, but for example, our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend, and when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it, and we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside, because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set-up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when they told us to wait for them. And we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. so that part is upsetting and our work doesn't back us up at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so often when something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job that's yeah that's how they do things so that that is upsetting um most of the time i dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um yeah How are you at controlling your hunger? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing a car with today, and we were arguing where to go first. And so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And after this was one of the things that's over, then we're going to do some more of her things. That's good. Yeah. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, is that what that is? Uh, no, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. yeah my father noticed some symptoms my father's just well I just passed away but he it was a psychiatrist well I wasn't sleeping I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon or something like that, and I didn't have a focus, like, for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door, and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. No. Well, I went for three years, and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. And I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double-check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods, I've noticed in my past. And right now we have it work slow down, so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for me personally. As a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and deal and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. Have you ever seen change in your behavior? Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting, let's say, but it's more negative. Like I have been sort of thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with, you know, just kind of, in my opinion, crude weapons and no medical help and I don't know, my mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that and I've been looking at it and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that or other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Is there anything you regret? Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I had a I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. And I didn't get out of college with a degree, although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to at certain points I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car so a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. So. I see what you mean. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Well, I've been told I'm very patient. you know also I have some original original artistic ideas so those are those are good qualities I'm very loyal and and also you know I support my friends I'm fairly generous with them Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. Okay. Okay. It's my pleasure. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Yeah. That was very interesting. Have you finished?",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/356_P/356_AUDIO.wav,0

I don't like to argue but there was I was arguing with a girl who's working in a movie theater and she was giving people wrong directions on which line to stand on or and she was she was causing like hassles and I was saying you know they have to stand over here and don't send them over there they won't get into the to the film screening and there was some argument going on and And of course I was in the right. She was giving wrong information. This was at Grauman's Chinese Theater. Okay. How close are you to your family? Well I do have a twin brother that I live with but we don't get along with total opposites. I have a sister I haven't seen or talked to probably in eighteen years. I have a younger brother. Don't see him much. What's sad I just have a mother who's still around she's like 70 75 Probably in the last three years. There's no communication. No phone calls. No Facebooking just Just separate it. It's like we don't interest each other Just the way that she's always I don't know well never had a father the father left when I was four and and she's always been a housewife, always getting, she's always been on welfare and food stamps, I just, it never really worked. I just wish she did something more. She just, you know, I do love her, but we don't have a relationship anymore. Yeah, I understand. Mm-hmm. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Who's been a positive influence? Probably good writers. Probably some of my favorite authors who inspired me to write better. I don't know. I like the writer, like William Goldman. He's a very good writer. He wrote Marathon Man, and he writes about how to write screenplays. He wrote The Princess Bride. He's been an inspiration. Nice. Yeah. When do you think it's going to be? What was that? When do you think it's going to be? Today's kids. Oh just I can answer that with two or three words well two aspects it's just too much too much video games too much technology too much skateboarding and just better with in the 70s when I grew up we didn't have to we weren't locked in rooms or sitting in front of screens for hours and hours and hours. This is 2013, everyone is just trying to, life is hard for everybody and everyone is just trying to get through it. It's tough. How would your best friend describe you? generous and funny and fun to be with and just an all-around great guy no no yes by six years ago What got you into this job? I probably, when I probably went to a, probably, I went to a free clinic. Things were bad. I was probably interested in medication, and then when they offered it to me, I decided not to deal with it. I don't, I don't, I don't want to take medication or anything. I was taking Lipitor for high cholesterol and getting too many side effects, fatigue and sleeplessness and dizziness. I won't take medication because I'm a creative person and I just suffer depression probably all my life you know I have my highs and my lows just just feeling blah walking around and just not feeling anything you know I'm feeling good about anything I'm excited about anything just bored so bored all the time I don't lately probably I never felt so bad in my entire life just this is probably last few years have just been really bad I'm in survival mode about it it's pretty bad I'm just become a boring person and I go to all these free events all the time trying to save money I'm out I'm out every night I'm rarely ever home out all time having a good you know going to events having a good time then but it's like I'm just trying to shut out life I live in movie theaters just trying to just block everything out that's that's not good no wasn't really into therapy but you know again he was a Korean guy just said yeah your depression you have suffer depression you may I may be bipolar but you know I just I'll deal with it well believe it or not if it's if it's just dark and quiet I'll say pretty good eight to ten hours sometimes because I snore sometimes I'm not allowed to sleep but sometimes I get kicked out of the apartment. It's a small apartment. And I've slept on alleyways. I've slept in doorways just to experience it. I'm not homeless because, you know, that's when I can't sleep. That's when I get two or three hours. So there's your answer. Inside, I can sleep okay. Because I'm always fatigued. I'm very tired, and I'm a heavy snorer. I snore like a chainsaw. There you have it. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm okay. I'm just, people can tell, I'm just drowsy and probably irritable and just want to just let darkness come and let me just get at least four, five, six, some sleep at all, please. If I get some, then I'll be okay. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I had a gambling addiction. I was trying to mess my whole life up. You pretty much lost everything. When was the last time I was happy? I probably took $60 to a casino, turned it into $1,200. So I had $1,200 in my pocket. It was exciting. But of course, the next few days, that $1,200 was liquidated. that went because I was stupid and got greedy but that's what I'm happiest probably go to a casino and and win or just stay even and not lose anything that's that's where my adrenaline is yes it has it got me put me where I am today to us blackjack it's bad but otherwise in the past three years I haven't had you know no I don't not much I don't get it. The gambling is not worth it. But in the end, you lose everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Policy accepted. I am generous. I'm a nice guy. I'm not going to do you wrong. And I'm very reliable. All around good guy. I'll help you out. I'll lend you a few dollars. I think I'm alright. No, nothing at all. I just hope, I just hope, you know, that there is a second chapter in my life at my age. Right now I'm just floundering, killing time. Probably been four years now, just of nothingness. Say that again. Manage your money better. I would never think I would have six figures in the bank, but I did. But a lot of it just evaporated very slowly. So that advice is probably just don't. Don't gamble. Keep your money. Try to find some other means of excitement. But for me, being at that blackjack table with big wages was my reality. That reality was better than being outside the casino. My reality was right there. Now, Texas Hold'em, I did okay. I didn't lose much. I'm a pretty good player. But that blackjack, it just took everything. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money. I had a lot of money.

361,17,1," Okay. Okay. All right, there you go. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me if anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? So, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. How about you? Where are you from originally? I'm born in the U.S. I was born in Orlando, Florida. Why'd you move to LA? My parents. My dad had a lot of friends in Los Angeles, so we decided to move here. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty different. I mean, the place I was before was very, it was a very small town. You probably won't even notice it on the map. So it was a big learning experience because, you know, the schools were a lot larger and different cultures and ethnicities. So it was a unique experience. How often do you go back to your hometown? Last time I've been back was probably about five years ago. How does it compare to L.A.? Definitely different. My aunt, she lives in, again, she lives in a small town, so if you want to go to a movie theater, you have to drive out at least an hour, least an hour if you want to go to a mall it's an hour drive so it's complete opposite of Los Angeles the convenience everything everything I could possibly want is here the weather is great shopping a lot of friends here sports LA is just kind of like the perfect area you know you know I want to live here kind of for the rest of my life actually. What are some things you don't really like about your life? The big thing would probably be traffic. I mean, wherever you go, there's going to be traffic, whether you're on the 405 or the 101. It's just traffic. It can kill like two hours in your day, which is huge. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, quite a bit for personal and for business. I travel, you know, usually overseas or domestically. I travel so and I enjoy it a lot. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different places, different areas, meeting new people, eating different kinds of food, being able to sightsee and tour if I have a day or two free. It's just experiencing, having new experiences just enriches my life. What do you study at school? Um, computers. Um, and I also did English as well. Are you still working in that? Yes, I am. What do you do now? Um, I work in IT. In an IT department at a semiconductor company. What's your dream job? Um, probably working for Apple. Um, since I pretty much own everything they have, uh, yeah. It'd be great to work for Apple. Do you consider yourself an introvert? What are some things that make you really mad? mad good question policy uh... attendee little bit more uh... just kinda keep my mind off a little bit uh... but usually doesn't last long sites the product tight tend to eat out a little bit more more kinda like maybe junk food or something I think I'm pretty good. I rarely get mad, and if I do, it doesn't really last that long. So I think I'm pretty good at, I guess, controlling my temper. Again, I really don't get angry, so it's not really an issue for me. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? I say during the elections. We were talking about President Obama and Mitt Romney and who would be the best fit for the next presidency. That kind of got a little bit heated, but it was more for fun's sake than anything else. But it was an interesting conversation. What do you do to relax? I like to eat out a lot, watch movies, play video games, just go out, shop, play sports, watch a Laker game if I can. In person would be probably the best. Bowling, photography, I like to do a lot of different things. And of course electronics. How would your best friend describe you? Have you ever served in the military? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? uh... just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before i sleep uh... other than that it's pretty easy uh... i say a little bit sluggish tired uh... kind of reaction times a little bit slower uh... aside from that uh... i think nothing too much like too glaring or anything uh... the usual just being sluggish not moving as quickly as i should How are you feeling lately? Pretty good. I have no complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. Pretty much the same. When was the last time you felt really happy? I guess today. I had my car maintenance today and it didn't cost me anything so that's great. great and I thought it was gonna cost me you know something extra on the side but you know the the service advisor waived it so I got everything free today so actually I'm a really good mood no nothing probably don't spend as much save more money aside from that nothing else just Just be kind of more wise with your money. Who's been a positive influence in your life? I'd probably say my best friend. He's kind of helped me out and I helped him out as well. So it's been kind of a great learning experience, developing our friendship. He's bailed me out a couple of times, I bailed him out as well. So it's kind of, it's a mutual thing we do, you know, with each other. And, you know, it's a great way to bond as well. What's one of your most memorable experiences? years ago when I was a kid I was actually kind of afraid of some of them but now that I see them you know recently they've actually mellowed a lot and they're actually pretty fun to talk to so it was kind of a learning experience for me because they're you know they did a complete 180 from when I was when I was a kid. What are you most proud of in your life? I say, I guess work would be part of it. Buying the car that I wanted, it took a couple years to save up to buy the car, but I paid it all off, so I don't have any more car payments, so that's great too. you know being able to help my family out as well why risk um... couples going to las vegas for c s which is great if you into gadgets electronics get to see all the uh... the goodies coming out this year so that was uh... pretty interesting to see and uh... somethings that uh... you know when you read on blogs they didn't talk about so you get to see it actually in person kind of experience it from uh... user standpoint so i thought it was great uh... and it's just fun it's kind of like being a kid in a candy store you get to play with different gadgets so it was really fun for me Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/361_P/361_AUDIO.wav,0

It's the hardest job in the world, but it's the best. What's the hardest thing about being a parent?

It's letting them make their own mistakes. What's the best thing about being a parent? The unconditional love my boys have for me. Being a parent has made me a better person. It's made me a better everything, a better employee. I think having my children made me a much better person every day. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Probably I have a lot.

363,17,1," Okay, great. So everything's all set up now. Okay. So I'm going to pull her up, and then again she's going to ask you some questions, and then she'll let you know when she's finished. Okay. No, that's okay. Okay. That's okay. Use your hair. When you have this much technology going on, something is bound to happen, right? Of course. So we'll just keep going. Okay, so I'm going to do something for our purposes. It's kind of spooky. All right, so whenever she's done, she'll let you know, and then you can press this button. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people in the same sense as their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also, you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But, you know, you live with that. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major so I studied business and after I finished college I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No, as a matter of fact I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I am concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over I switched over and worked in a creative business which was a graphic design firm and I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You can almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle, but I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not, well, I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. I mean, when I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh sure, you know I have, a couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operations and it had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new, I don't just openly say, well, you know, I've experienced this, this, and this. I just basically, if it comes up, I won't deny it. Or if it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is, I'm currently living with my mom, my mother, and she's a senior citizen, she's alone. So what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your hunger? I'm not a short fused kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. So as far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. I'm trying to think here I can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with and I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago and they weren't very understanding of the situation and I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was I was more than willing to take care of my issues but they were playing hardball and I didn't care for that It does. Probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was, it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who was battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him, there was a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would kill him. And that was really tough, it was a really tough decision to make but I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could help save his life or if we didn't take a chance and take that extra step that I would regret it in the long run. That sounds really hard. It is. It was. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, right now I'm separated from my wife so she has her issues, I have my issues. But but we are not divorced we are just separated and we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together and the relationship with my mother is really great you know she's very understanding I'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her later stage of her life she's 82 years old and so she needs to I guess it's good that in its own way maybe fate has taken place because you know someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child. What is something you feel guilty about? probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage as far as the things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah, I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had and we were growing apart and when she was away my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. And so, you know, I spent a lot of time in the casinos and what eventually happened was I spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel in that moment? I felt when it came to light I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. No, not at all. No, not really, no. I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever spent time in the theater? No. The only thing I can say is after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so I tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and he basically said to me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue, no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart attack. and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medications. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I guess number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight. just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can, if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret obviously, my marriage, my working career as far as I had a long career with this major food chain and I basically because of my gambling issues I ended up ruining a very good career but at this point right now there's not much I I can do. I can't change what's been done so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me everyday. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself and make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably, what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person. I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, years it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and that I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. And every day that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night. One day at of time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things but I cannot do those things anymore. How would your best friends describe you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easy going, generous, a nice person to be around and you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend? Well my ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around 6 o'clock. I go to a local park and it's about, this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning, get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that I home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax and then just kind of kick back for the rest of the day and then the next day I do the same thing again. In the morning I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever, just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. me. Thank you. Bye. Lock yourself out. Okay. I actually got comfortable talking to him. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/363_P/363_AUDIO.wav,0
364,17,1," therapy like this instead of with a live human. It'll put all the MFTs out of business. I'll explain to you about what her purpose is and what they're hoping to use it for. I'll just... I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to... If it's someone that might just go and questions might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being it might be a little less biased also. Yeah, exactly. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording, and then I'm going to actually turn this light on to make sure it's bright enough in there. Now she is... Okay, great. So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know when she's going to say end of session? Yes, she'll let you know. Okay, cool. Thank you. All right. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. Now we're ready to go. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born and raised in Los Angeles, and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away, but I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Really? Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida, I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert. say Palm Springs, Palm Desert but also another hour and a half, two hours away you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also, the regulations. I'm a small business owner, so all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, etc., some of the other western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. it really does most people don't understand it but it's um also uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's the big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of so that's you know but People don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses. Because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries. And I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit. and I've learned a couple of languages, and I surf. I'm sorry? I didn't really understand your question when you said like what. I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back, and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax where is warm water to surf it's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and workout and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life oh sure One of my favorite trips of all time was I used to, when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span. But about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city. Even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. We really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping. But really, having been there so many times, I really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about, you know, almost a month and really get to learn the city. And it was fun. Even though I grew up in L.A., I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish-speaking population when I was younger. So my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable. but I took French all through elementary, junior high, and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French. With the French, you know, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... I have a few different degrees. So I was a Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a Master's degree in Economics, and I have a degree in Crisis Management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy. I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting being from Southern California going to school in Maryland. And I originally went to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products. And it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather and recently father passed away. So I sort of run an 80-year-old family business. And it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it. But it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Hmm. Actually, probably my dream job, I think, is fun. I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home. And I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter. And I didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked. But I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids. that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that having pretty much worked for most of my life. So it'll probably never happen, but it sounds something that to me would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted but I think when I feel comfortable with certain people and I don't know what it is I can meet a stranger and be totally confident or people I might have known for years either from a personal or business situation and be more introverted I just go with the dynamics but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally and reason I used like to use the term reserved oh wow that's a great idea I used to have that on one of my several computers at home and that used to be one of my screen savers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, you know, maybe going surfing when the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes, it gives me like a brain freeze even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best. Or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more, had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your hunger? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. you know I am more likely to think before I speak now whereas say 20 years ago I was more likely to act before I thought so might have said more things that I you know whatever tense situation whether personal or a work situation but I've never had a violent temper but I would have the temper where I fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. So I think a lot of that comes, I think the key word there is maturity. Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years, what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Just basically one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different. And I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just, I don't know if I'd call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall. And I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married to someone, have children with them. That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have. but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that, I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children how she did. And it was more, not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things. but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match. Whereas other things looked good, you know, on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Hmm. When recently, my father passed away recently, thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invite very very close friends and family members i was more or less sort of in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i invited a i kept it very private and I really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it. So I really only invited, because just because of the time pressure, really just a handful of people. But now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends. You know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years. and even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish that's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it. So I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also because it was something that was coming. It was inevitable. So. Well, both of my parents are recently deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that I have three other brothers, one of who passed away in December. And we're not super close. Like I always, like I look at other families, we were just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different. And I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strained, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah, that's how it is. But, you know, to strangers and most people, I say, you know, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, you know. But I think every family has their own sort of stuff. No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life. And I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past just from, you know, I was in the military. And I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was. But I think I function pretty well. But I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. I didn't enlist I was an officer I went to one of the service academies 17 I started one after high school and I went to a service academy so it's more prestigious just as an enlisting it's the heart of where I went it's the heart of school in America to get into I was about the same age as everybody else that went there. We did. 1983. Just basically it wasn't anything intense. We were just around, we were just, we weren't allowed to carry ammunition. We were just, our positions were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us. So that was, uh, that was, it wasn't anything too, uh, too intense. It was a lot, you know, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you, you actually play in the game. The same with, you know, if you're in a combat unit. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, where people were from all over the country, and I got to meet, whereas most of, say, my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles, like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds and I ended up becoming just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, grows up with that kind of pride. So I thought it was good. And unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. because it was just so different. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. But it was a great experience. That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It all depends. If I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life, I generally sleep pretty well, even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep pretty well. How have you been feeling lately? I feel pretty good lately. You know, I've been, like anybody else, more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great, pretty much. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, not really. I think I seem a little happier and more content lately. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I thought maybe in the past, because I do have a family history of it, and it wasn't anything real too debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own, but I was concerned with it and sought counseling. I do I was really against it in the past and until after I went I mean I wish I went more say during my uh my marriage or the course of uh my life now I think it's very useful however in the past I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etc but I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it just some questions I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life I prefer someone who's older than I am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. But, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a 180-degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues I want to bounce off, I do have someone that I can go to. Okay. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people i've sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man but it's I think it's a useful tool I got some good ideas it's nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and is not in your day to day life instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. This morning. I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone, and I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates, I clearly have, I'm having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather, and I had a bunch of errands to run, and I clearly have seasonal affective disorder, But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out. And when the weather's nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's dark and blue and rainy and cold. I know that term. But I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. How are your best friends? Most of my friends, I'm sort of a renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational. I'm very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues. and I help talk them through it or I'm resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car. I'm great with medical diagnoses. People also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. I also have, I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. With me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't BS. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude. I'm not rude to anybody, but I pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much... No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. I've tended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who had the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years. and knock wood and maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye-bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. Okay. This is Dixon. Oh, I'm sorry. It's like those old-fashioned, you know, like, ray-bans like this. Oh, yeah.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/364_P/364_AUDIO.wav,0
365,43,1," 1.5 tbsps of butter Okay. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing alright. That's good. Where are you from originally? New Jersey. Really? Yes. Three months ago. Not very often. It's much different. I don't know. It's a lot more crowded here. To start a new life for myself. How easy was it for you to get used to living in L.A.? It wasn't very easy at all. It was quite rough at first, but I'm still trying to get used to life here. What are some things you really like about L.A.? I've met some good friends here. I love the Hollywood area. The mountains are beautiful. That's the kind of things I love. What are some things you don't really like about L.A.? The traffic. I understand. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really, no I don't. Why? Just haven't had the time or the finances to. Okay. What did you study at school? Digital media. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I've always loved, you know, computers and designing things, and I just kind of fell into it. No. I dropped out. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? Well, I guess my dream job would be working in something that I went to school for, and I never really completed my education. But I guess it would be great if I went back to school and finished my degree in digital media, and, you know, finished and started working, you know, doing something in that field. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A little bit of both. You know, I can be shy at times, but I like to push myself to be outgoing. You know, it's kind of a struggle for me, but I don't want to be, you know, in a shell, so I kind of force myself to be outgoing. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Listen to music. I sometimes just drive and play music in my car, and that helps me relax. Nice. Or I smoke a cigarette. Like what? Oh, like what? Oh, um... Just heavy metal. That's all I listen to is metal. Awesome. How are you at controlling your temper? Well, it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry I am. But I do my best to not get so pissed off. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? And I don't know, she She wanted me to come and pick her up She was a little drunk And we just kind of fought over the phone Over some other things And I just ended up not picking her up Because of her attitude on the phone with me. That sucks. Yeah, it does. What's something you feel guilty about? Something I feel guilty about is not talking to my kids often, or as often as I should. I've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that I don't really have time to talk to my kids as much as I'd like to. Yeah, that sounds really hard. You have no idea. Is it easy to be a parent? It comes natural But it's no way easy It's the hardest job that I love to do But right now it's extremely difficult for me Because they live so far away And I made this choice to come out here to LA And I feel bad that I don't see them You know But The reason I came out here was To better myself So I can provide for them Fear You know Just fear what You know You fear what's gonna happen to your kids You fear That Something awful is gonna happen And not seeing them brings about that fear a lot more you know and I can't always be there with them I can't see them it wasn't as bad when I was living in Florida and at least I used to see them, it wasn't very often but I still used to see them, now I don't see them at all and that's the hardest thing I've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids, if only temporarily. I don't know how long I'm going to be here for. I don't know what my future holds. But the hardest thing is being so far away from them. Yeah. I'm sorry you do that. What's the best thing about being a parent? Just the joy that they bring to me. I mean, I could be having a bad day, and they just cheer me right up I mean it sucks being away from them for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces it's the worst thing ever but I love to just see their faces they just bring a smile to my face and I don't know What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? reserved you know and he kind of held back like a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy but with me I I'm very goofy and silly with my kids and I'm strict when I have to be but I always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not I I don't want them to grow up too fast. That may have been... Yeah. Wow. Situation that I wish I would have handled differently. There's so many. I guess when I was still with my ex-wife, in Florida I wish I wouldn't have gotten so angry or I wish I wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and you know keep picking at me until I exploded and I allowed her to do that you know, I should have just walked away when I could and you know now let my temper get the best of me okay have you ever served in the military? no have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? no have you been diagnosed with depression? no how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? sometimes it's hard Sometimes I just lay awake in bed You know, thinking all the things that are going through my head All the stress that I'm going through With work And you know Making sure Wondering if I'm going to Be able to make rent Wondering what my kids are going through You know When I'll see them again If they even care about me anymore If they even know they have a father You know, those are some of the things that run through my head, and that keeps me up at night sometimes. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? A little, but, you know, I put myself in this situation, so, you know, I gotta bear with it. You know, I gotta... You know, you reap what you sow. So, I... I gotta deal with it in my own way. Lately, I've been trying to not think so much about you know, all that's going on in my life. I try to distract myself. And that kind of gets me in a better mood, you know, if I hang out with friends or just watch a little TV, something to get my mind off, you know, all the stresses in my life. That's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy was actually a couple of nights ago. I went out drinking with a couple of my friends from work. I don't know. We just got pretty drunk. That kind of helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head. So if I can distract myself, if I can forget about all that other stuff, then I'm happy. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Some of my best qualities, I guess that I'm convincing. I'm kind of like a, I guess you would say, a counselor to some people, some of my close friends. I may talk people into doing things that they may regret, or I may, I'm sorry, talk people out of things that they may end up regretting. Or I may just listen to people. I can say that I definitely listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need. When they're going through some troubling times like I'm going through. Can you give me an example of that? A man who lives in Florida. You know, I talk to him every now and then And he's been having troubles with his girlfriend And, you know, I just kind of Talk to him about his problems and listen I mainly listen because, you know I don't think he has anybody else to listen to You know, when I was living in Florida I was very close with him So, you know, he always relied on me And now that I'm here in LA I don't want to lose that, you know, connection with him for him, so he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice about what I think he should do. So I think he appreciates that, and I'm glad that he relies on me for that, and that he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I don't know. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so kind or generous. It seems bad, but sometimes people may take advantage of me. And I may not realize it. And I don't like saying no to people I like. to always please people. So if I can change that, maybe I wish I wasn't such a people pleaser. Has that gotten you in trouble? Sometimes financially in trouble. Sometimes I, you know, help others and that, you know, that may make me broke sometimes. I may not have enough to pay bills, but I feel better helping people. I don't know. Is there anything you regret? I regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner. Why? because she put me through so much crap in my life. And I was always trying to be a people pleaser. I was trying to please her. You know, trying to please my kids as much as I can by not breaking up, you know, the family. But there's only so much one person can take. And I think probably if I would have left sooner, I may have been happier, and things may not have gotten so out of control, out of hand, like they did, you know, during all those years with her. So, if I would have got out sooner, I don't know, I would have been happier, I guess. I see. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? It's okay to be selfish. It's okay to, you know, think about yourself sometimes. You know, if you keep putting everyone ahead of you, then you're not thinking about yourself, you're not thinking about what makes you happy. And even though pleasing people may make you happy, you have to think about yourself sometimes too, and about your needs. Because, you know, you play an important role in the lives of your close family members. And in order to keep everything afloat, you sometimes gotta worry about the one person that's, you know, juggling everything and holding everything up, which is yourself. So, be a little selfish sometimes. It's okay. Right. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I don't even know what a weekend is anymore. My ideal weekend would be locked away, alone in my room, watching movies, listening to music, just with my cell phone off, and not being with anybody. Or I could be out at a bar, you know, or, you know, watching a metal show. So, I like to be alone. But at times I do want to be out with others. I like, you know, being around people. Uh-huh. How would your best friend describe you? Crazy. He thinks I'm crazy for coming out here. But I guess he would say that I'm dedicated. And that I'm strong minded. And that whatever I set my mind to, I can do it. No matter how hard it is, I'm not going to wimp out. So I really respect him for giving me his insight. but I guess yeah I guess you'd say that I'm crazy but strong-minded my kids you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy all my kids, and you know, just having them in my life is the proudest thing I can ever accomplish, is just, you know, having them in my life. And although I don't get to see them as much, even when I think about them, just thinking about, you know, how far they've gone, you know, what they've accomplished in their, you know, in their short time it makes me happy and I can't wait to see them again what's one of your most memorable experiences? one of my most memorable experiences I guess that would be in Florida I went to see our favorite band, Skeleton Witch. It was a great night overall. One of the nights I'll never forget. Just because we've been looking forward to it for so many months. And it finally happened. It was surreal. It was a great night after all. Overall. Nice. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure, you're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Take that off.

366,20,1," Thank you for watching! Ok, sounds good. Uh-huh. Yeah. I'm great. And you? Los Angeles, California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity. I feel LA by itself is a country. There's so much to do, so much to explore. And there's nothing like it. I see what you mean. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. I would say traffic. And the real estate prices are kind of crazy compared to the rest of the country. But other than that, then, you know, that's fine. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I have traveled. I have traveled a bit. I would like to travel more, though. I've traveled, I've been to a few countries. Like what? I've been to, I want to say Europe, that's a continent. I've been to London. I was born here, but my family is from Nigeria, so I've been to Nigeria a few times. I've been to Denmark, Amsterdam. I've been to, where else have I gone? Germany. And I think that's it. Yeah, I think that's it. Awesome. Yeah. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just exploring new places, seeing new things, meeting new people, a different culture. It definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it. And also going to countries that may not be as developed as the U.S., it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of this country. okay well let's see london i actually actually when i first heard about going to london i really didn't care for it because i didn't know much about it the only thing i remember is watching mary poppins and um but um when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it um just It has the hustle and bustle of LA, but at the same time you can go at a very, very slow pace. We didn't do any driving. We just went on the tube, which is their underground subway station, which I absolutely fell in love with. And just exploring different parts of the city. We went to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey. When I went there, they had the premiere of Slumdog Millionaire, and also they had the premiere for Seven Pounds. It was a movie with Will Smith. So Will Smith was over there, and me and my friends were kind of screaming like we were groupies, just for antics. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. It was a lot of fun. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. What did you study at school? Business management. And an option in human resources management. What that means, I have no idea. How did you decide to do that? Good question. I've always wanted to go into business. And I've always wanted to study finance. but I didn't think I would learn too much about finance from college per se. I think I learned more in the real world and whatnot. So the other option was human resources, and I'm always fascinated about relationships and people, always reading articles about that stuff, so I went for that. Are you still doing that? No. Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but i i work in property management so um it has to do with people anything to do with people i'm fascinated about so okay yeah i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for you that was a good one um my dream job wow i would say being a life coach I would say that was my dream job because I love helping people become successes and I love being a part of someone else's success, regardless of how small it is. Whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation. I just like helping people have a better life. So I think, you know, I do it for free. I do it for free. Like all day. Yeah. Yeah. More outgoing. Definitely more outgoing. I'm usually the life... Well, it's weird because I'm usually considered like the life of the party. I'm the one who's cracking jokes and making everybody laugh. At the same time, I can be very, very quiet into myself. So, yeah. Right. To relax. I usually listen to music. I usually listen to music to relax me. Or I pray. To relax myself. Or listen to some really calm music. So, yeah. Very good. Very, very good. I used to, I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known to go off, quote unquote. Not in a, you know, not throwing chairs or anything like that, but I'm a very, very patient person. Once that patient is gone, and for you to do that, you have to really, really, really, really push my buttons for a long time. Once it's done, I just go off. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. Mm-mm. No. When was the last time you argued with someone? The last time I argued with someone? Wow, I haven't argued with someone in a long time. Boy. Mm-mm. I argued with my... No. I would say my, I think my dad, I argued with him about, what was it about? We were disagreeing on some things about when we were supposed to go back to Nigeria. And he wasn't listening to, it was kind of like a group discussion. Myself and my siblings. And he was being very subjective. He wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and concerns. So it started an argument. How did you feel in that moment? Very, I wouldn't say angry per se, but I felt very, kind of like I was losing control. Like, I'm the type where I like to be in control of my emotions and my thoughts, and I feel once that patience is gone and I start going off, it's kind of like this, you know, I don't want to call it a blur, but I'm very witty and quick with what I say, so I'll instantly say something that, you know, I'm not going to say hurtful, but very direct and to the point. I make sure I get my point across. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have three brothers, one younger, two older. I'm very close to my family. My mom is one of my best friends. My brothers are great. love him to death my father he's more so out of the picture yeah what's something you feel guilty about? hmm I don't really, I'm not the guilty type I don't feel guilty I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to what I do not want to shy away from responsibility but i don't think i ever feel guilty for anything i do yeah i don't think i feel i i usually don't feel guilty okay yeah how easy is it for you pretty pretty easy um pretty easy at you know pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited or i'm reading i'm trying to when i'm when i'm focused on learning something like i'll read and read and read even when it's past my bedtime but now i'm trying to work on waking up much earlier than what i am now and that's kind of a little bit of a struggle but i'm getting to it so how have you been feeling good um i've been feeling i've been feeling fine you know i'm I'm generally very very happy disposition and so no deep depressing moods, nothing like that. Whenever if I do feel like I'm going, I don't allow myself to go to that place. No. No. Sorry. Thoughts? I would say... I wouldn't say necessarily changes, but I'd say more so behaviors, learning how to let go of past decisions, maybe. And kind of how they played their course in my life. I just, sometimes I kind of look back and say, what if I did this? What would have, how would life be now? Yeah. So, those are some games I play, but other than that, that's it. Is there anything you regret? Regret. No. No. There isn't anything I regret. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Oh, 10 or 20 years ago. I would say, don't be afraid of who you are. Be authentic. More importantly, with yourself. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Erase from my memory. I would say when I tell my dad that he should act like a father maybe i should tell me about that yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother And my senior year, I was overloading with everything. I had maybe like four AP classes. I was working three jobs at the time. And I was also on track and field. So, needless to say, I was kind of like burning myself. I was kind of like burning myself out. And I wasn't doing well in AP calculus. Because I decided to go to a JC first and transfer. Also to save money for college too. And when I told him, you know, the teacher called saying I was falling asleep in class. Just because, mind you, after school I'd work an eight hour shift because I was a retail manager at the time. So, and I'd come home after that shift to do homework. Calculus, let alone. So, he would get upset and I told him, I spoke to my counselor and I already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC. I'm not going to continue with it, I can't drop out at that point in time, so I'm just going to take the D or fail or whatever. And he didn't like that, because he is a teacher. I think maybe that's where it came from. He's a teacher as well. And so he started blaming my job, and wanted to call my boss. I lost and it was just too much. And I told him, you know, since you're my father, you should act like it. But it was a more aggressive way I said it. So that was one thing. Well, actually, I do remember, I do regret one thing. and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin it was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i want to say 19 because i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with dad and working i just kind of like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would have continued maybe that's one small thing but that's something small though yeah what would you say i'm very i'm a very compassionate and understanding person I like learning new things I'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice I'm very objective I'll tell you the good, the bad, the ugly and yeah, those are some of my best qualities yeah I'm fun, I like to have fun I have fun in any situation I can make light of any situation I'm the type of person that can break the tension in the room that sort of That's sort of a personality trait. Cool. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Michelle's taller. Besides my height? Hmm. I wish... Maybe... I don't know if it's being more in touch with my emotions, but I think I would say understanding how people feel about me in their shoes. I think that would be one thing, because I'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me, and I'm like, okay, great, thank you, I appreciate that. But I don't realize how much they do. I think that's realizing how much they care and love me. That's one thing I would like to get more of a grasp on. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend? She describes me as someone who's funny, crazy, objective, loyal. Ambitious, hardworking, mean. My wife makes jokes, she says, you're so mean. But I just like to, I joke around all the time. And so we were, right now we're actually planning a friend of mine, a friend of ours, a baby shower. I'm giving her some ideas. And there's another friend who was invited who... We had some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to or hang out with. We used to be really close, but I don't really talk to him in person. But I don't mind them being there. So she also talked about celebrating her birthday. Also, kind of like after the baby shower. And there's another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower. Who we didn't do anything for. And I'm like, well, we're celebrating this person's birthday. might as well we should definitely you know honor this person's birthday as well since we're closer to you know the person whose birthday is past and i said you know what just when we celebrate everybody's birthday forget the baby shower just do the birthdays and then that's when she said you're so mean but she was laughing about it so yeah that's good yeah what are you most proud of What are you most proud of in your life? Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay, thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Have a good one. I can take this off? Yeah. Okay. Thank you for watching!",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/366_P/366_AUDIO.wav,0
367,63,2," Are there any parameters or should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whatever you're comfortable with, just talk naturally. I'm going to go ahead and just fix this. Sorry. Okay. Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. a little down, but more or less okay. I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland, on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school, But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, D.C. to do some work, and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in L.A.? It's very different. Being from the East Coast, it just has a different feel to it. But living in L.A. has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of... I lost my job out there, and so I had to move out here kind of quick to be with some people who were going to help me out. I don't know if estranged is the right word, but I'm kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? it's not easy it's it's kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now i'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet so it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? It depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy so it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I have certain, I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing. And when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world, the music and the thoughts just kind of happening really, it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed, I guess. When was the last time that happened? What was it about? minutes he has on earth with her just because sort of it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing well I've always I've always been a writer part of the reason I came to LA was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since then I've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I I've been meaning to write a novel I was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me It's not easy. The parts, when it's good, it's really good, but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it, I just absolutely love it, but sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. Good. I don't really have a temper. I mean, most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. if something is really really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I've that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I'm upset I I get upset with myself not with other people When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument, and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong, and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is, yeah, it wasn't a blow-up argument, but it was a definite argument. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? a lot, so much. I was in a relationship that I really, really, that I really wanted to work, and I ended up, And it was partly due to I hadn't I was on I wasn't on the right medication. And so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control. And I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I mean, I wasn't I wasn't mean, but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it. and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough well some of it was was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean, now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of, I mean, I still get, I still get upset and I still get depressed, but it's not like it was. It's not, I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So, I mean, I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain, then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now, then I would be, it probably would have gone very differently, or maybe it wouldn't have. But, I mean, I could have, I don't know. I don't know if I could have done anything different, things being how they were. I mean it's it's possible uh I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do I I take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and i feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Well it's it's not easy I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But since the medication, it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy, but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with that? Well, like I said, I do a lot of, if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything, I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. If I'm watching TV, I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using the computer, I have to be, you know, watching a TV show or a movie on, you know, in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need, I mean, I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I just, I can't yet. They're triggered by everything, pretty much anything that I, that I see. If I, if I, if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name, if I, if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin, if I hear, you know, people talk about just anything, you know, I can reach back and connect to, to this. It's really, it's really, I don't know. That's the thing. I mean, I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper, so I'm awake and asleep and awake. I have no problem going back to sleep, but I generally don't. I don't know. I never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. like I would I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it's it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep I don't conk out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's Yeah, I don't sleep too great right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Pretty, I mean, I don't know. It's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just, I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad. Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? years before that, but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said, you've actually got this situation, and we need to get you on, the medication that you're on is not working, you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to, like, even you out and heal you a little bit from all this, so, so yeah, that was, that was kind of a, a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so in the moment I don't know I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now, it makes me really angry that I'm, that I had to, that I, I lost everything because, because of chemicals in my brain, because of things that I couldn't control. And that, you know, the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean, I was paying, I was paying a lot of money to, to go see doctors and they were doing, they, you know, it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now there really wasn't any choice. I had to, I was, I was a mess. I was, it was either, I was, I was self-medicating, it was affecting my work. I mean, it was, everything was just, there was a point where I really realized that, I mean, I just had to like make this different. But again, it was too late because, you know, then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough. Not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to AA so that I can keep control of that aspect of it. And there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately, being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of la so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've only seen her three times in the past year So it's basically to keep my medication coming. Okay. And then there's you. Yeah. Right. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, like I said, I mean, just the talk. I mean, let's just take the AA, for example, because that's probably the closest for that I'm seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting this stuff out, trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step. Like, regardless of who you're saying it to, whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drugs, you know, I mean, you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can deal with, something that you can write down, something that you can talk about, as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. Right. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? Um, you know, better than I, than I have been. Um, I mean, it's sort of, it has its ups and downs. Um, you know, I'm applying for jobs, five, six jobs or more a day, you know, and never getting a response, never getting an interview, never even getting close to to to being self-sufficient again it's hard but that's like real-world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just I have to deal with real life which is it has its own challenge Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, it was probably, you know, a couple of years ago. I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree and we spent all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel You know, for that instant, I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really, really liked a lot. And, you know, everything was going really well. And, I mean, it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up. But for that instant, I felt like a normal person, a normal happy person. And part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. What are you most proud of in your life? probably the probably this educational series I did an educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation it was it was really hard but in the end it turned out really good and I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about the world around them. So I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? It was part of, you know, as part of my, my job, it was, it was a, we were trying to come up with, with new ideas for, because we would put together videos and stuff to give, you know, to, to schools and everything. and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it yeah tell me how you spend your ideal weekend I guess I don't know I don't know it's been a while since I've since I've really thought about that. I don't know. Would I go somewhere? Would I... I don't know. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Thank you.

368,35,1," That's why some people do it on a tape recorder or something. Even if it's just getting out. That's true. You know, writers do that a lot and things like that. Yeah, you're right. So, yeah, research shows that that's really beneficial. Okay, so I'm going to get all this started up for you. All right, just one last thing for you to do. Great. Okay. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, I'm okay with it. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Um, I'm okay. I'm okay. Um, I guess. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm basically an LA kind of guy. What are some things you really like about LA? You know, the weather. It's usually pretty sunny and temperate. I like the climate really a lot. I like the girls here. I like, let's see, I don't like the traffic, you know, but I like the Hispanic population quite a bit, you know, and I have a lot of friends here, so I guess, you know, I don't want to be anywhere else. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Like I said, the traffic, you know, I was on the 405, you know, that's always kind of, you know, crummy The cost of living, that's really, you know, terrible about LA, it's always expensive And, you know, I really don't like I really don't like, you know, the Like, it just seems like LA is one of those places where, like, you know You either have, like, you know, a ton of money and fame and fortune or, like, you know, you're down in the, you know, the ghettos, you know. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've been to a couple of places, you know, but very brief, you know, mostly for school. I went to Arizona and New York and Montana. a lot of anthropology, like, you know, and archaeology, field trips, and things like that, nothing I'm doing right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like getting away from the city, you know, I was in Yosemite last year, you know, in the summer for vacation, that was kind of nice, you know, Yosemite was really, really neat to see, but just basically getting away from the city, I guess, you know, getting away from the job, getting away from the stress here. Yeah. What did you study at school? I actually studied political science, and I also studied economics. I'm a big kind of political, you know, junkie, you know, to begin with, so I naturally kind of fell in line with that kind of field of study. Are you still working in that? I was, I was, but I lost my job. and you know that's kind of a bummer you know um i lost it uh geez it's already been maybe a year and a half for now maybe two years and um you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know um i wish i was working there again well I wanted to be a lawyer at one time I wanted to be a lawyer and I um and that's why I took political science and I took a double major in economics and um the sad thing is the sad thing I I regret is I, you know, to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the LSAT. And I studied for, like, really hardcore, you know, for about a year. And I took the CAD test, and like an idiot, I didn't feel right about that day. It was kind of an off day. And, you know, it was like, you know, the big game at the Super Bowl, you know. I just, I don't feel like I did well. And I canceled the test, and so, you know, I kind of regret that, you know. Tell me about it. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Um, I'm not really shy at all. I'm definitely not shy. Um, but outgoing, I mean, I'm one of these, I'm not a flamboyant, you know, um, I, I talk to people. I don't mind talking to people. I don't mind, um, meeting people. That's fine with me, but it's not like I'm, you know, dying to, dying to meet anybody, you know. Yeah. I see what you mean. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. I guess. What do you do to relax? These days, you know, I play guitar. You know, I taught myself how to play guitar. Yeah, thank you, thank you. You know, I should actually be doing more of it. But I also like to exercise. I'm on a diet right now but my diet's been terrible eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great I love to exercise I love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out I just wish that my eating habits were in line or a little bit better you know okay how are you at controlling your hunger? um my temper could be, you know, definitely improved a lot, you know, um, you know, a lot of times, I feel I'm one of these introvert types of persons, when it comes to, like, you know, I don't mind being extrovert, or, like, meeting people, and, like, having a good time, whatever, you know, when I'm mad, I really don't want to be, you know, talking to people, I don't like to yell, I don't like to scream, I don't like to hit, I don't like to fight, I kind of close down a lot, I don't, I just want to be left alone, sometimes I tend to drag it on for longer than it should, you know, the wife doesn't like it too much, and maybe I, you know, I just don't, I just don't want to talk about it, I just don't want to deal with it, I kind of close down and shut, you know, shut off for a little bit. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Jeez, um, you know, it doesn't happen too often, maybe with my wife, you know, probably something silly, who knows, who knows, um, the thing, I mean, I don't have a lot of guilt, I don't do anything, like, to make me ever feel, like, you know, that bad of a person, you know, um, there are things that, like, you know, um, I call minor sins, you know, I get white lies or whatever, you know, but, like, nothing, like, so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty. Can you give me an example of that? Um, let's see, I guess sometimes, you know, um, you know, I'm a married guy, but, you know, sometimes there are times, you know, I like to, you know, smile at a girl, or like, you know, get a girl's attention, you know, I don't know, I never go, I never do anything about it, I never get the phone number, or like, you know, but sometimes I like to like talk to people I guess you know well that's a good question I guess I guess you know see I always handle it the same but there's I don't ever wish to ever to ever change and I never want to like handle things differently I always kind of, I'm pretty comfortable the way I handle things, and, you know, I think that, um, I could be a lot worse than, like, you know, shouting, and screaming, and hitting, and this, and that, and that's just not me, um, you know, I think the best thing to do, you know, is kind of, like, get a lot of breathing room, a lot of space, and, um, I don't wish for that to change, or to handle any of that differently, I just don't basically know what else to do, you know, um, and, you know, the last thing I want to do is start talking about, you know, feelings, or any that's the last thing I want to do. And so I don't wish that I handle things like that differently in that way. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I'm pretty happy with my family right now. I'm married, and we have a baby along the way, which is kind of nice. We have some cats. Thank you, thank you. We have cats and a dog, a weenie dog. and, um, my mom, I love my mom dearly, um, uh, she has diabetes, which, you know, she doesn't control, you know, she doesn't control it, and, like, it, like, uh, it affects her health, and it always has me worried about her, and, like, stressing out about her, and she could do so much to, like, prevent it, and she doesn't, and, um, you know, I have a good relationship with my mom, I love her dearly, and I actually have good relationships with everybody, I think, I think I have a ton of family and friends that get along with me pretty well, actually. That's so good to hear. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? There are times, I mean, it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep, actually. I feel like, you know, I sleep like a baby. The only problem I have, I think, is I feel like, you know, sometimes like you fall asleep And you have, you're just going to sleep and you kind of like jolt, you know, like you almost kind of like fall It's like a falling sensation or something like that And it doesn't happen that often, but it happens And, but for the most part, you know, I sleep like a rock, I sleep really good well right now generally i've been feeling um worried and and anxious and um you know uh and tense and the reason why is because i said my mom um right well at least today i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kind of waiting till this is over so we can, I can find out what's wrong with her, but, you know, I'm worried about her, she's in the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good, and, you know, I'm trying to find a job, so that has me worried too, you know, the baby along the way, so that has me worried, so I feel, like, you know, overwhelmed with just a lot of, like, you know, things to do, and, like, and a lot of my plate, and, like, a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me, but I have to handle it, like, you know, so, like, I guess. How do you cope with that? Well, I keep myself distracted, I keep myself busy, I feel like a busybody, you know, and the more, which kind of, you know, seems like it's not a good thing, because I feel like I'm just adding more things on my plate, so, you know, like, one of the things I do is, like, exercise, and so I have to work out every day, you know, but that takes an hour, It takes an hour to like, you know, change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling down. It takes some time. And then like to shower. All that kind of stuff takes time. But I have to do it daily. So I cope with it in that way. I also cope with it to, you know, playing guitar. But that's just more of a distraction. You know what I mean? Keeping, you know, keeping busy that way just seems like it's not, you know, working towards, you know, the goals, you know, that I need to do. Like, you know, find a job, which I should be doing. But then, you know, it's one of those things where, like, I find, like, there's no good jobs. I've been looking and looking, and, like, sometimes when I do, it's just not what I want to do. It just doesn't seem like I want to, like, do any of these, like, terrible jobs. That sounds really hard. It's, you know, it's probably harder than I'm thinking about it, because sometimes I feel like, you know, one of these things is, like, I feel like it is hard, but it's not, I mean, there are ways I can cope with it. You know, I just got to, I kind of accepted it a lot, you know, I kind of internalized it, and, like, you know, it's not something that's, like, I'm not out on the streets or anything like that, but, you know, it is a worry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I've never been diagnosed with PTSD. I used to work with... Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Man. Ten years ago? I don't know. Let's see. The last time I was really happy, maybe... I mean, I feel like nothing makes me happy no more. I learned a new song on the guitar. I feel like not even happy about that, you know, I feel like, you know, I work out, sometimes that kind of makes me happy, you know, running like, you know, fast and working out, but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that, it just makes me feel good, you know, so I have these times where I'm just, you know, feeling good about myself and I'm feeling, you know, but I'm never feeling great, I'm never feeling happy, I'm never feeling like so sensationalized, like, you know, and, you know, incredible that, you know, it's just, you know, there's these mild times where there's a few good times, you know, and a few bad times, but the good times are never extremes, you know, never really good times, and never really, you know, atrocious bad times, you know. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? well, I wish this diet would work out a little bit better, you know, but that's kind of hard, you know, because I'm the kind of guy who just likes, who just likes, you know, you know, rice, and, like, Mexican food, and, like, you know, the snack, and I don't know, I just feel like that I could change, I wish I could change my eating habits, that way I can, like, you know, because I work out so much, I feel like I do so much running, and so much activity, that, like, um, you know, that if I got my, you know, diet in check, um, you know, that, that would, um, go a long way, I wish I also can change, you know, um, my, my, uh, I guess my, my desire to, like, you know, get ahead, like, right now, I feel just so, um, like, the economy is so bad, and, like, things are so, um, rough that, you know, it's, like, pointless to even, like, you know, look for these kind of jobs so like it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like to um do things the one thing i agree is is not is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um you know not canceling the test to begin with because i'm sure i could have gone into a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really want to pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like you know just to um just to be powered on with more work and things like that i don't know it just doesn't seem like like uh i mean there is a this idea of justice and and um and republicanism and you know things that i really you know adhere to that um i fall in love with and that i don't want to get away from but it just seems like it's a like a ton of work and money and just to like um for the small percentage of success that that you know you might not be able to do in that kind of field you might you know i'm like it just doesn't seem like like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? you about and you know i think you know i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid i've you know pretty cautious about this you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that i think that real people have you know um and they really like you know ruin their life you know so like i'm pretty happy and content with with being, you know, the cautious, you know, I don't know. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? Oh, my best friend, I think he kind of likes me. He wishes that I would do more things with him, but he works at night. And, you know, it's one of those things I think most people, not just my best friend, but my wife and maybe the rest of my family feel that I don't put a lot of time and attention to them. I mean they think that I'm pretty great when I do give them my time of day and my attention but I don't know if I'm really there all the time. I don't know if I'm really ... I'm always thinking about something else. I'm always thinking about something different. I don't know if I really can give them a real shoulder to cry on. If they ask for something, I'll usually do it, but I almost feel like it's a chore. If they really need me, then I'll do it. If they're just asking for a favor, I almost feel I do it with a lot of lackluster, a lot of half-heartedness. And it's not because I hate them or anything. I don't really like them. It's just that I feel like I almost, I don't want to say I owe it to them, but the mere fact that I'm their friend makes them somehow, you know, like, it makes me, like, you know, they rely on me, you know, at times, like, I don't want to let them down, they are my friends, but at the same time, I just feel like it's more, it's not, it's not, it's more of like a chore to do instead of a willingness, like, oh my God, like, I just want to help you, it's never like that, it's just something that I do because I kind of have to, you know, you got to, you know, gotta do things for your friends, you know, in the end, because they're your friends, you know, and in the end, I do like them, and they probably would do it for me, and I, you know, so I just do these things, you know, just. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, there are a couple of things that I do like, that I feel good about myself, you know, So, you know, I ran the LA Marathon. That kind of feels good, you know. I've graduated from college. That kind of feels good, you know what I mean? But the thing is, I don't feel like that proud of myself for, you know, those things alone. Like, graduating from college, you know, hasn't really made me successful. You know what I mean? Running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim. So, they're like half merits, you know. where like they're great, you know, a lot of people maybe not have done it. A lot of people have excelled further. But, you know, they're kind of like stepping stones that like that I feel real no lifelong benefit from doing other than the fact that I can say that I've done. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Yeah, yeah, no problem. No problem. thank you for your time you know um i hope you enjoy you know uh being in this computer thank you goodbye oh goodbye i'm gonna press this button now I think we're good here. Okay, wait. You can go ahead and take off the headset. Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and shut things down here. You can go ahead and have a seat right here. I guess I kind of did that. I'm just going to be a little bit more active. You know, I'll be talking to myself. Or talking to the virtual community.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/368_P/368_AUDIO.wav,1
369,25,1," Okay, awesome. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. So, how are you doing here? I'm great, thank you. Where are you from and where are you from? yeah it's pretty cool you know oh i haven't been there actually i haven't been back to my hometown since forever uh just you know i have all my family here my mom my dad my cousins aunts uncles so practically i have my my life here so i probably i mean it would be nice to visit but you know just my curiosity hasn't you know gone there i guess okay um i love the people everyone's nice i love the diversity you know there's different types of people and imaginations out there you know everything's just great you know everyone's different you know no one's like the same at least to some aspects um and i love the scenery I love, you know, the mountains, they're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know, it's nice, it's pretty active, yeah. What are some things you love about the smog? Ah, the smog, I don't like the smog, it's just, you know, if you go out, further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear, the sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah, but, yeah, that's, you know, pretty much, LA is pretty nice, you know, I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know, I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job? Hmm. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds. And, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, you know, or help, you know, help them, you know, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Do you feel self-conscious or outgoing? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could, it just, I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever, I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking, I just, I prefer just to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on something else, you know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose, yeah. I like to kick my feet up in the couch and like read a good book you know just get my mind going to another you know galaxy or universe or situation you know it's pretty fun you know just you know reading and then just having just yourself relaxed and you know feeling good yeah it is it's just fun i love reading um i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know temper controlling person there is out there you know i try my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep doing better eventually but I'm not like the best I mean I sometimes I do have my outbursts you know um but you know I guess that's everyone I'm not sure you know ah huh that's a good question um hmm I don't remember let's see uh honestly i can't recall maybe my goodness i i don't know i sometimes i'm very passive that that's just like let things go because i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things you know so um huh i don't know I'm not I I can't I honestly I can't tell you that at this moment sure yeah probably come back to me um huh well I guess when I was younger I you know uh could have been better older sister and I I wasn't, and that makes me feel guilty, for sure, you know, I could have been a better sister, better role model, you know, but I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better, and it's working, yeah. I guess huh I don't know I mean I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life so if I erase something then it's just there's something of me in my present self or you know that would change and I don't know I'm pretty okay with the person that I am now I mean you know I don't think I would change an event you know I'm okay with what you know ups and downs and good than bad that has happened. Yeah. I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess I love to explore like, even the smallest things like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top you know somehow some way and just make it you know um traveling uh i would love to do that but i don't know just you know always circumstances in my life that doesn't you know always something you know i get married children you know and all this so it's kind of like you know it would be nice i guess you know it would be nice you know i love camping that's kind of like you know taking a few days trips out there camping and you know fishing yeah um it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice it was just me and him you know and it was like no one and it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake and you know it was it was really nice it was just yeah yeah yeah yeah it was it was it was really fun it was like i would love to do it again you know right now it would be great you know just going out there it's just i love the adventure of things and the nature and just life and you know overall yeah uh it's it's easy but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because i don't know just you know just i'm laying there and i'm just like trying to go to sleep and i'm just like ah but eventually i do you know i just i probably like need to position myself in a different side of the bed like sometimes i'm in the headboard and i'm like oh i gotta go to the other side and once I position myself then I just like go to sleep you know but it just I gotta find the right position for me yeah um I'm tired I get tired throughout the day you know but I kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to, like, make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know. So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's just, you know, it's okay. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But, yeah. Okay. Have you been diving in the sea for a long time? No. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. It is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible, but that's just nature. my immune system has to work harder super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant you know I was really really happy about that and I was just like oh you know that was really really good you know very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time i've never really like uh you know but yeah i'm yeah very happy um i don't know um i guess just me myself i am you know like you know i could you know just be myself and that's it you know just i can't really you know say i have a specific thing i guess i mean it depends on the person that meets me to tell me i can't really tell myself like oh i'm this i'm that you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to you know tell me or you know compliment me or whatnot yeah oh nothing i think um like i said i'm happy with the person i am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have i don't know whatever flaw people see in me and it's okay you know i'm okay with it whatever it's just i'm not gonna um i can't change myself for the likings of other people i have only one body and one life so yeah yeah that's it uh just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know it's you know you learn from that you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve. What advice would you give to someone who's going through this? Just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're going to get through them eventually, you know. The only thing you can't, I don't know, you can't, you know, go back on is death, you know. You could, you know, have a heartbreak or whatever, but, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still gotta keep going yeah um I don't know um that's pretty huh most proud of I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be and that's pretty powerful you know I'm you know I try to be you know a better person each day and try to like you know improve myself every day as much as I can you know that would probably be something I could be super proud of you know as much as I can very hard I'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know because I can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know and you know it's always challenges and everything that goes, you know, in your life, but, you know, it's just, it's sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while, you get a lot of practice, and everything's just like, you have a great day, and you didn't even try, you know, so, yeah.

370,17,1," Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I'm doing pretty okay, thanks for asking. How are you? I'm from here in LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley. Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I like the diversity of people, the different kinds of food you can eat. I like the outdoor opportunities. I grew up close to the hills, so I did a lot of hiking. Camping is pretty close by. I've gone snowboarding. I like the familiarity. I think it's a big city, and I'm pretty familiar with having lived here for so long that I would say I like that too. And probably the number one thing that everybody says, I don't like traffic. I don't like being stuck in traffic. I don't like the long commutes, even, you know, for short distances. And then, you know, it gets really hot in the summer at times. So, you know, I could stand it being a little slightly cooler when it gets to its peak heat, but that's fine. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? Wow, my dream job. That's a great question. I think my dream job would probably be, you know, maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it, profit off of it, you know, make gainful employment off of traveling. But that's almost an unrealistic dream since I don't know if I would actually want to do that. But if I had to pick some kind of dream existence, you know, traveling, getting paid to travel, meeting new people, trying new things, and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun. What do you enjoy about traveling? Well, I like, like I mentioned what I like about LA, I like trying different kinds of food, different cuisines. And so I think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people, seeing different ways of life would be is what I like about traveling. I like experiencing new things. I think that would be nice. You know, despite the fact that I said I like the familiarity of L.A., there's also fun in discovering new things. So I think when I travel, that's that's what I like to do. Just check new things out. And so I would like to be, you know, if I could make a living doing that, that would be great. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips? Okay, well, let's see. The last trip I took, let me think of one more exciting trip. Well, my family is from Eastern Europe, so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was 14 was I went to Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and getting to see some of those old cats. I'd been a few times before, but it was when I was little, so I don't really have too much memory. Plus, I didn't really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age. So I got to see my family's old hometown. We have a family tomb, so I got to see that. Then just these old buildings and just a different way of life. I really like that. you know, seeing my parents' old friends, you know, and so that was pretty fun. It was very different. It was like really my first time being taken away from my, my home environment. You know, I left in the middle of the school year. So it was just like going from, you know, suburban America to traveling around, kind of, you know, taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old, like hundreds of year old towns. And I don't know if it was for everyone, you know, I don't know. It would be great for everybody, but I really enjoyed it. Awesome. Awesome. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? That's a good question. I do, I probably, one of the things I do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom. I used to, I watch The Office a lot, so I kind of know when that's on. So I'll turn that on, you know, just kind of zone out a little bit to, you know, like familiar characters and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason. Or maybe like eating some kind of comfort food. You know, I try not to eat too much fast food at all, but like In-N-Out, I really like going there so if I have to unwind you know once every few months maybe I'll do that or I really like to read especially like I'll read the day's events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world I still I'll read the headlines and I really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me so I really enjoy that that's something I do to relax I would say I'm pretty great at it although I don't I think my nature makes it pretty easy makes that pretty easy I don't I don't get very upset easily at all so it's not much of a challenge to control my temper yeah I don't really have anger issues it's difficult for me to get angry so I don't really have much trouble with that at all. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody was probably... I don't even know. I mean, small disagreements I might have had with family or friends about things, but just a full-on argument, I can't even remember. It's been years. I don't really argue too much. I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my personal life. I don't really see anything to be gained by it, and I kind of naturally repel away from it, so I don't have much to say about arguing. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? something I feel guilty about I would say that uh you know some I sometimes I don't really um I feel like I maybe I haven't made the most of my potential yet in life I think that I could definitely do more despite the fact that I work a lot um I I feel like I there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing I feel like you know sometimes downtime I feel a bit guilty about that because there's always something that I could be doing that I'm not, even if it's just putting away the laundry that's been, I took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or running late. I really don't like running late, although it happens more than I'd like to. I don't know why I feel guilty about that. I don't like keeping people waiting because it makes them feel like, you know, my time is somehow more valuable than theirs, which is obviously not true. um um nothing immediately comes to mind I well the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i wish it hadn't happened not that i wish i i could erase it from my memory but i i was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i thought the cars in front of me were going um you know at least for a little you know 10 15 feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a you know slow rear end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and uh i wish that hadn't happened absolutely uh i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially any of the the people i got into an accident were fine but i was you know they they you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but it was just a horrible timing. Um, so I wish that hadn't have happened. It does suck. It did suck. I'm over it now, but yeah, it does suck. Well, I'm a pretty good sleeper. Uh, although I'm naturally wired to be up later at night. So So unfortunately, my job allows me, affords me a pretty flexible schedule. But on the same token, I wish I were like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because I just, I wind up staying up till one or two every night. And it's just too late. You know, even though I could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep, it's not always at nighttime. You know, half of my sleep is like in the kind of early daylight hours. I wish I were more able to sleep, you know, go to sleep at like 10 or 11 and then sleep, uh, and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later. I've been pretty, feeling pretty good. I've been, I have no complaints physically and, you know, health wise, I feel good. Um, you know, my relationships with my, My family and friends are good. Everything is great so far. I have absolutely no real complaints as far as how I'm feeling about myself or anything like that. Have you had a study to use any of the behavior and thoughts you've had? No, no, I've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts. I think that everything has been pretty okay, pretty steady. nothing traumatic nothing kind of resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has happened or is happening no no well I think there's plenty of things everybody regrets yeah yeah there's plenty of things in my life yeah like I said I do regret, you know, maybe not trying harder in my younger days. You know, there's a period of time in my early 20s where I didn't work for a while. I just hung out with a lot of friends. You know, I guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd. You know, none of us worked. We just, you know, we got high every day. Or it seemed like every day. I don't know. It was just kind of like a throwaway period of my life. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I would say that it's important to engage with the world, I think. I think I kind of dropped out from the world a little bit. I think it's also, I would say that it's important to recognize the people around you for what they are, you know, and what kind of potential, you know, future activities you can expect from the people you surround yourself with. I think that I would say also that kind of try to focus on what I wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking, well, you know, things will work out, which eventually they do. But I think that, you know, there's a bit of lost time with that approach. It's kind of fatalistic. And I think that I would say, you know, just try to concentrate. you know you know not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and thinking that things will fall into place that makes sense tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself well I I guess when people I don't especially take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason I think that at least for myself, I sort of have things figured out, although I'm sure I'm wrong about that. So I think just maybe in terms of like group work that I've done professionally or academically, you know, when some of my work is kind of picked apart or scrutinized, I don't deal well with that, and I take it more personally than I should. When was the last time that happened? It was probably about a year and a half ago. I was working on a research project at work, and And somebody with much less, it was three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it. And there was somebody just out of college, you know, went over what we had done. And, you know, it's just kind of rewording things. And it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of changing things. And I kind of took personal offense to that just because I thought I had a lot more experience and more education. and it was unnecessary. I thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and I didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to necessarily redo all our work or even to, not to redo it, but to edit it or to proofread, I guess, to make any kind of qualitative changes. I just thought that it was a really bad idea And I thought that, you know, I shouldn't have viewed it this way, but I thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience, you know, was kind of like an affront to us who had worked on this project. But, you know, it wasn't our call. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Most memorable experiences? Well, I guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my, the first real trip I took by myself. I took the Amtrak to New Mexico, and I was out there exploring things for about 10 days on my own. So that was kind of the longest period of time up until that point. And I was in my, I was, I don't know, 23 maybe at the time that I had really just been on my own, completely cut off from everyone. I was in parts of New Mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time. And it was very memorable because I was on it on my own. I felt like I was really, you know, exposed to things I wouldn't have seen if I had had traveling companions. And it was a lot of fun. Nice. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Well, I've been very happy recently. I'm getting married in a few months. I got engaged on Labor Day in 2012. Thanks. So that was a very happy day. This whole process, you know, of meeting someone, and we kind of progressed very quickly, recognized where we were. So I've been in a pretty happy state the past, well, it's been 11 months now. But, yeah, so I think that the day we got engaged and we shared it with our family, I think those have been very happy times. New Year's was happy, you know. I'm in a happy period of my life right now so yeah yeah thank you with a sort of sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets I'd say also you know helpful calm relaxed maybe intelligent likes to recycle I know that's something that they would say what else I think that my best friend might say that I like animals I've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person I mean an animal person also fairly easy going flexible with plans I'd say one of the most proud of in my life well I'm pretty happy with the level of education I've gotten I'm also going back and starting the fall. I'm starting a PhD program, so I'm happy about that. I'm happy about, you know, breaking some of my bad habits from the past. I'd say if I'm proud of anything, it's that, um, you know, I have a strong faith relationship. I go to church often. I'm very happy about that. I don't know if pride is the right word, but, um, my relationships with my family and friends are all very good. Uh, I'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about 10 years ago. You know, the, the change, I'm, I'm happy and proud of that. No problem. Have a good day. Thank you. Goodbye. So, just one second.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/370_P/370_AUDIO.wav,0
371,40,1," Okay. Yes. I'm doing pretty good, thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in the San Fernando Valley in California. Really? Really. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the beaches. I like there's just many things to do. And you can't beat the weather. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Uh, traffic, cost of living. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Uh, no, I haven't, uh, I've only been out of the country once. Or a few times, actually, but only to one other country. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, they were when I was younger, before I turned 21, and we used to go to Tijuana across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that. What do you enjoy about traveling? Well, I love to see new things, new places, and have new experiences. Cool. What did you study at school? How did you decide to do that? Are you still doing that? What's your dream job? Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I would be on the outgoing side. Why? Just because I'm more outgoing than I am shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A lot of times I smoke marijuana. How are you at controlling your temper? Not the best. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? I had an argument with my mother over how we should handle doing things with my grandmother well we just had differences on who should do what at what times and who's in control and I should pretty much let her follow her rules because it's, you know, she's her daughter. Well, it's okay. I understood. We talked it out and, you know, realized that I might have been overstepping my bounds. Uh, it's fairly good. I am pretty close with my mom and my grandmother. I have a stepfather and a half-brother. We get along okay, but we're not very close. And I've never met my real father. Uh-huh. What's something you feel guilty about? Um, maybe not accomplishing as much as I should have in my life up to now. Have you done anything to avoid it? Uh, yeah, maybe by not having enough ambition or drive to be in a better position in my life. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, one of the hardest decisions was when I moved away from Los Angeles to Wisconsin. Tell me more about that. Well, when I was younger, I was getting in trouble, and I was looking for a way out so I wouldn't continue getting into trouble. And I, with a friend, we just packed our bags and moved to Milwaukee. Wow. Are you happy with your bag? Yes. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? extremely difficult. I guess I got a lot of things going on or not going on and it just makes it hard for me to sleep. Issues in my life. And sure, sometimes. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I guess it depends on what I have to do. Do you feel down? Right now? Mm-hmm. A little. Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Well, in the last few minutes since we started talking about depressing stuff, I'm starting to feel a little more down. I haven't. No. Very seldom. Very seldom. Stop thinking about them. Are you triggered by something? I don't know. I couldn't answer that right now. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I guess I felt it's been a while since I've been really happy I don't have a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed Well, let's see. I did go to Las Vegas a couple months ago. I had a good time there. That's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Well, I'm an honest person. for the most part reliable. I think I'm easy to get along with. Wow, where do I start? I have plenty of bad decisions I could erase. Yeah, well, I have a DUI on my record. Well, for the time it's suspended, my license makes life extremely difficult. Can you tell me about that? Well, yeah. It's hard to get around when you can't drive legally. And if you do drive illegally, you're at risk of going to jail for driving without a license. Has that gotten you in trouble? Well, the original charge did, but I haven't got caught driving since. How would your best friend describe you? I don't have a best friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, let's come back to that one. Okay. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Maybe that I could follow through with some of my plans. Be a little more ambitious. maybe not some of the decisions I've made in my life I have regrets take care of business first and always handle your responsibilities What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Good weather, good music, good company, good conversation. Uh-huh. What are you most proud of in your life? Wow, I don't have an answer for you. Okay. What are some things you like to do for fun? I love to bike ride. I can go for walks or hikes. I love to swim in the ocean. That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. Can you tell me about that? Well, she was a single mom with two kids and worked really hard to raise us. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it wasn't easy. How close are you to them? Very. That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye. Okay. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/371_P/371_AUDIO.wav,1
372,72,2," There we go. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious to talk to people in the same sense as you and I are. I'm not a therapist, but I'm very learned about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions when we start. And please feel free to comment on your questions. Your answers are a very important one. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Um, pretty good. Kind of. Good. Yeah. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? The thing I like about LA? The weather. What are some things you don't really like about the way you live? It's not easy to meet people. Can you tell me about that? Well, it just feels like people aren't out very much. Like that movie in Crash where people are just in their cars all the time. and it feels like that. No, not too much. Okay. What did you study at school? Child development. How did you decide to do that? Well, I have a son, and I wanted to know how to be a good mom, and so I wanted to know about the stages that he would be going through and be able to relate better to him. That's great. Are you happy with your job? I am. Are you still doing that? Kind of. I'm trying to get it started again in the fall. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? I'd like to write. Nice. Tell me about that. Well, I've written some children's books and I've just been doing research looking into getting my books published. It's only like two that I've written so far, but they're pretty good. I've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups. it's about a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with him and it puts him in like a really he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life um no i've had some issues with nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so no I'm a single mom it was the hardest thing I think in the world is being a single mom so how do you cope with that? how do I cope? well right now I didn't have very many coping skills or mechanisms, so that was the problem. What's the best thing about being a parent? It's so spontaneous. like the stuff that comes out of kids mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend so yeah pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me I need to not be single anymore the hardest thing not wanting to screw it up I felt a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make a difference and matter and what kind of person like it turned out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself yeah yeah definitely I think I'm different from my mom because I'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction I welcome it you know I welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that I want them to be, but just see them become the best child that they can be, the best adult that they can be, without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person. Say it again? Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Who's someone that's a positive influence? Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. I don't really have anybody like that. Okay. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? well I've tried to meditate sometimes but I don't really stick with it often enough um I've tried to like go for walks but I don't always do that And I'll always stick with it. So. Yeah, that's about it. I'd say. I'm a little below average, meaning that I get angry more than most people do, I think. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? It's kind of stressful. It's really crowded. And my husband is stressed out about it. And, you know, I'm just saying to him that I told you so. I told you if my sister moved in here, then there was going to be a mess in the house. And she's going to be asking for things she don't really want to do. That's just how my sister is. So the house is messy and it's crowded. And every day they're asking for rides. And my husband, he's avoiding coming home because all these people are at home, and he doesn't want to be there anymore. And I'm just saying that he's going to have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it, in my opinion. So it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had done differently. Oh, I've got tons of them, but right now, what's on my mind is losing custody of my son. Right now, like, I've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want him to be treated. Like, they don't have any boundaries. and I believe that boundaries are important, establishing who's the adult, who's the child. They let my child boss them around and stuff. Anyways, because of this, they're going to be testifying against me in the custody trial, saying that, yeah, they're going to be saying that I'm not a good mom because I believe in having boundaries, and we have very different ideas about child raising. she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife and she's she really doesn't she's really far removed from how I was raised and I want to raise my child more similar to how I was raised where we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us. And with my stepmom, she wants no rules. She has no expectations. She just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants. And that's fine when you're a grandparent, but the problem is that I live with them sometimes, and when I'm in the same house with them, they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules. anyway yeah in that moment just really frustrated because they don't listen to me I feel disrespected I feel like invisible I feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that I worked really hard to do I went to school and I studied child development I read all the magazines and I read the books and I really I know what I'm talking about I feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities. And to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as I have to be a good parent try and tell me that I'm a bad parent, it's really hard to believe. So I feel very disrespected, unacknowledged, angry, frustrated, all those things. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? So, sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed. But, I tried to push them out. And then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I could go to sleep more easily. Yeah, I'm always thinking about my son. How I wish he was with me. And how unfair everything is that's happening. and like I don't deserve to have my son taken from me because I'm a really good mom you know and I'm too hard on myself so but I am a good mom and I feel confident that I'm a good mom like yes I don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me and right now I'm trying to be okay with it because I know he can do more for him financially than I could but that doesn't mean I'm not a good mom I'm pretty depressed I'm on antidepressants I take Wellbutrin I've been on them for a couple weeks now I think they're working I don't know I'm not as down as I was I mean I got here today I got dressed that I made it out and I'm here today. So, not that bad. My husband complains a lot. He says I'm not the same person that I was when he married me. He said I was fun and I was positive and there was all these other optimistic things. That's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night. And I'm not those things anymore, which is true. I mean, we got married a year ago, and then my son was taken shortly after, and it was just such a shock. and I've just been trying to get back from it but it's been hard did I think I had a problem before I found out found out what oh um yeah i like crying a lot sometimes like i cry all the time it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there or um I don't know it's just all the crying I think and like I said my husband letting me know that I'm not the same person so he's disappointed and I feel bad even that I'm not the same person that he knew I feel bad about that too another thing I'm feeling bad about you know you still go to therapy now? yes I do I try do I feel like the therapy is useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems I go in there and I cry every week so at least I have a set time every week where I can go in and cry um that's I mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes I feel better afterwards um yeah and she helps me make decisions you know it's helped me to be more proactive in my life um well i'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here why don't you work there have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so I went and applied to go back to school you know I'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so I'm trying to find a work and I applied for college in the fall I got accepted to Dominguez Hills so I may be going back to school in the fall right now I'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kind of stuff, just giving me ideas that life isn't over, that there's still more, you know, I could be doing with life, yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Everything's always bittersweet. I don't know. I don't know. Last time I was really happy. I don't know. My ideal weekend. Oh. I don't have a lot of money because I'm not working right now. So really, my weekends are just spent reading maybe. But I can't really, I can't pay much attention when I'm reading. So I have a short attention span. I can only read a couple chapters. But lately, I say that's what I've been doing is reading. Something I've read? There's... Okay. Okay. I like to go to USC. They have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art. It's called Visions and Voices. So I like to go out to their events and I usually enjoy those About two weeks ago Deborah Harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches So like I said, I'm trying to be a writer. So I try to go especially to the book signings and see what it's like to be an author who's talking to a crowd and signing books. What are you most proud of in your life? My son. How are your best friends around you? I don't have any friends. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities? I'm smart. I'm good looking. I'm really... I like a hard worker. I'm dedicated to self-improvement. That's all I can think of right now. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye. Press the buzzer now. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/372_P/372_AUDIO.wav,2
373,43,1," Do you mean testy levels or anything? Actually, if you can just move around a little bit. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, did I get an avatar out of this one too? Great. Let's go with that. One, two, three, four. Okay. Now she's going to ask you some questions, and when she's done, she will let you know. Okay. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and say things that they're tired of. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything Your answers are very confident. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Doing okay. Doing okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? North Carolina. Really? Yep. When did you miss LA? Almost four years ago. Wow. Why did you miss LA? I graduated college and had an internship out here for a production company so I started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since. How often do you go back to your hometown? Probably at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there. That's good. How does it compare to LA? LA is only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect. Where going home was going home, now going home is like going back to see my family and seeing some friends. But I feel more like I belong in Los Angeles than I do back at home. What are some things you really like about LA? The food, the weather goes without saying. I like the resources there. I like feeling, I like that the things that I want to do are much easier, much more accessible out here than they would be in North Carolina. So I feel like I'm able to pursue a lot of my passions, ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in Los Angeles than I am in North Carolina. What are some things you don't really like about Carolina? I mean the cost of living isn't great but sometimes too I always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much resources so many resources out here so it's not even expensive as New York or Boston so it's not the worst but and also I mean it's a little bit annoying that every time I do want to go home it's a flight not a drive I can't I mean really conceivably drive home for the holidays it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical. So it's unfortunate I'm so far away in that respect, but I can't really change geography. I studied history and media studies and production. Yes, I work as a freelance writer producer. In college I realized I was pretty good at it and I knew there was way to monetize that and I came out here and worked a little bit in the public sector and trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized I could make more money have more control over my schedule in my life if I did it freelance so I've been doing it now for a little over a year now. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Awesome. What do you enjoy about traveling? to just eat a lot of food that I love in the places where they were originally created. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Yeah, sure. I went to Barcelona, like I said, a few months ago, and that was mainly because I had a friend who was living there for six or seven months, and she kept asking me to come out. And I finally, I was at a point in work where I'd been working so much for months on end that I felt like I deserved a break, so I went there for two weeks. and yeah, it's one of the healthiest, smartest things I've done in a while. So it reminded me again how important it is for me at least to travel and to get out of the world. That's so good to hear. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm very outgoing. I love talking to people and conversing, even virtual people. Oh, I lost you. sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got what do you do to relax um to relax I uh listen and play music a lot I like to read I like to go see movies I cook I cook a lot, so I enjoy cooking. My girlfriend and I are currently separated by distance, so I haven't seen her in weeks, and that can be very sad, obviously. So I'll talk with her as much as I can. But, yeah, just a pretty simple taste. Okay. Yep. I think I lost her. I didn't know if it was a mix-up. Yeah, I didn't know if I answered her question, and she was like, are you shy or outgoing? I said outgoing, and then she went away. I was like, that was a direct response. That's okay. Yeah. No problem. No problem. This is awkward, isn't it? I don't really have much of a temper, so very good, I guess. I don't really get angry easily or quickly. And when I do, I'm usually aware of it enough that I can kind of formulate how I feel and why I'm feeling that way and what I want to be done about it. So it's pretty, I guess I'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Honestly, it's probably something petty over, like, misremembering when something was done or like at the date on something or like a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled and it was just about yeah I think it's probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to San Francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other person's misremembering so in you know smaller big situations very difficult for me to actually feel enraged I guess in the classical sense of the word. I'm trying to think. I'm not one for regrets. I just recently did a project, like a film, and the subject matter had a little bit to do with an ex-girlfriend of mine. So when it came time to release it, I made a point. I didn't want to send it to her directly because I didn't want her to think that I was doing it to spun her face, but I did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff. And I, maybe that, she might have, could have misconstrued that as being passive aggressive. I don't know. But, but yeah, I mean, that's something I thought about, but I don't really regret it as much as like, maybe I could have just let everyone else who I wasn't necessarily sure about if I should say, to stumble upon it, as opposed to me directing it to them. So just my thoughts there. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I've ever had to make. It was actually probably that, I don't know, it wasn't even a hard decision. with like so with that the same ex-girlfriend i mentioned of as prior because i knew i had to uh break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult because i cared about her a great deal but also same team it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kind of go through that process it's getting on a roller coaster that you're very much aware of how terrible or frightening it's going to be but you know you have to get on the roller coaster so uh So yeah, I'd say that's probably a recent memory. What made you decide to do that? Just abundance of reasons that this person was probably not the best person for me. So like I said, I didn't have to weigh too much data to figure it out. It was a pretty clear sign. And I have no regrets about doing it now. I feel very strongly then about it. I still feel very strongly that I made the right choice now. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks. But yeah, especially having my current girlfriend not around, she's a very big source of comfort around, so I like that. But she travels a lot for work, so it's something to have to adjust to. And sleep can be something that suffers from that. But in the same respect, I'm not someone who actually, I feel like I don't need too much sleep. If I can get four to six hours, I'm in pretty good shape that day. How have you been doing lately? anxious, I guess, a lot more just, just whenever I get off of an assignment, there's always just the question, like, what am I, what's going on next, and so far, I don't have the next project lined up, so it's always that nervousness, and in the past, something usually does come up, so you have the precedent of it usually working out, but until it does, you're always a little anxious, and it can be depressing, because it's like a, you know, I've chosen very much a lifestyle that while I get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life, it also is all on me in order to do it. Sometimes I'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up, going to the office for eight hours, leaving, and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or company carrying them through when it's a little tough. Whereas with me, if I have an off day or if I'm a sick day, that no work gets done. I'm a small business that has one employee. How do you cope with them? How do I cope with them? I assume you mean, I guess, people I work with. How do I cope with the, maybe the better answer would be how do I cope with that lifestyle? I've gotten much more used to it. It's something I'm still learning and figuring out how to handle as far as not just like, I know how rewarding the work is when I do it, but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do I what's an appropriate way to budget finances what's the expectation I should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that I'm sure will take years and years to do but I feel like as long as I'm getting better at it then uh it's progress right yeah have you been diagnosed with depression uh yes uh definitely once and then probably I would have gone back uh I was gone in high school probably it would have been second time but um but yeah I've been diagnosed with depression once so I feel like it's one of those things that uh is something I have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um I feel like I'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh as they I hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to fall and I get that it's a self-esteem thing because it's so hard to feel um so it's so easy I suppose to get in your own head about that. Uh, this was within a year. So I probably was feeling, uh, symptoms having been there before. It was kind of easy to figure out like, ah, you know, that's kind of happening again. So I feeling, uh, the symptoms again, uh, uh, and going through those emotions and feel like, okay, uh, first I was kind of hoping it'd be something I could kind of work through myself, but, um, I realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own. So I went and, started seeing a therapist. What were your symptoms? Really bad. This was when I just couldn't sleep at all. I would get maybe an hour of sleep at night at best. I wasn't sleeping at all. Had just no drive to do anything, whether it was as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment, things like that. And just being, at the same time, simultaneously being aware that it's like, oh, this is all in my head, and it's not even like a symptom. So yeah, just a general malaise. comes with depression. Uh, no, I just finished up, uh, finished up. I mean, since I didn't graduate or anything like that, but I got to a point where I felt like, uh, um, I kind of talked through as much as I could talk through and I moved on and other places in my life. It was kind of a good, good work. And like I said, I was, I was working on something I really cared about. Um, I'm now with someone I care about greatly. And, uh, um, there's such a potential opportunity for me to, to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that I felt like therapy was not necessary. Also, I just didn't have the time to with as much work goes on. So Oh, I definitely Yeah, I think having someone you can confide in, who isn't your friend or your family member who will, you know, have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or like that is definitely something beneficial. I can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on somewhat of a routine basis. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't know. I'm a firm believer that all those things that can haunt you are also there for a reason. My sister died when I was about 12 years old, and she was younger than me. and watching my parents, like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me. And it, uh, I felt like I grew up a lot that day. So it's how it's so difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child. I don't want to forget those things. I think they are very integral to, um, how I cope with life and how I perceive, uh, um, hardships and obstacles and, uh, having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing because it's so easy to kind of you idolize your parents i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's an easier identify with uh the man he is what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago so i'd be uh 16 or 6 um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you to realize how people how much people didn't think about you it's really hard to tell a 16 year old and i don't have the point of telling a six-year-old but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school it's like that's i mean nowadays i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world. So. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm a very compassionate guy. I, I'm there for my friends. I'm pretty selfless in that respect. I have a good humor about things like even with, even with being depressed or depression, I can joke about it. It's not, you know, I'm not a morbid depressed, more just the, I'm aware of when I'm low and I treat it as such and I don't, you know, I don't try to deny it. I don't try to like that, but I have a, I'm a pretty practical person in that respect. I don't think, even when I'm depressed, I don't take it out on people or I don't think people, people have told me they don't seem to, when I mentioned that I've been going through like depression, no one seems to say like they didn't mention it. I, for one, feel like when I do go through it, it's like, oh, everyone can just tell and I'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically. But no, I tend to carry it pretty well and I don't lose sight of the reality of what I know is happening. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I was on, my girlfriend came, she was in Thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to Spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about 10 days And, um, yeah, I know. I love her. She's great. Um, she's the coolest person I know and so much fun. And she, uh, when she's around, she makes me so happy. And, uh, um, so having her for 10 days and we just had like normal, we rarely get normal couples time. Like it's always like, oh, I see for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere. Um, so to have 10 days, just normal, where we could just cook dinner at home, like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and it makes me so happy that I have someone that I can do that with and just it feels so practical and feels so right. That's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you? Um, I guess for, I mean, just to be clear, I'm a good guy. Like I, I know I don't, uh, I don't think I screw people over. I don't, um, I'm a good friend to have. I'm there for people. I look out for people. I care about people and what they think of me. And that goes especially much for my friends. And I try to make sure, you know, with a lot of my friends being on the East Coast, I try to carve out time to make sure that they know I think about them and I call them. And so I feel like for a lot of people who count me as their friend, I'm probably one of their better ones in just the sense that I know how much I appreciate and respect the friendships we have. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks, Ellie. Goodbye. Bye. She wrapped up. All right. Now I'm going to have you do the",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/373_P/373_AUDIO.wav,0
374,19,1," Okay. I'm just going to move around a little bit to . So then she's going to ask you some questions. She'll let you know when she's done, and then you can press this button and let me know when it's over. Okay. And then you can check the mic. That was good. Great. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions, then we'll start. And please feel free to send me a message. Your answers are fully confident. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Alexandria, Virginia. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to L.A.? I moved to L.A. end of 2001. That's a long time. Yeah, it's crazy. How often do you go back to your hometown? A couple times a year, usually, like for holidays. How does it compare to L.A.? It is, it's very different. I think it's a lot more mellow. It's way more like suburbia. It's nice. There's something comforting about it, but it's always like I get a little restless when I'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action. Why do you live in L.A.? I went to grad school at USC. How easy was it for you to get into school in your life? It wasn't bad. I mean, my program that I was in was so intense that, like, for the first year, it was so all-consuming that I really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment. It was just like my life was not my own. So that made it kind of easier, I guess. And also I was like in a community of people that I went to school with. So automatically I knew people and, you know, made friends and stuff. So it wasn't bad. Film. Hmm. I had an epiphany one day. I was out of undergrad. I was kind of floundering a little bit. I didn't really know what I wanted to do. And just one day I kind of was like, you know, what am I really excited about? What am I really passionate about? And I realized that movies are the thing that I love the most and I'm most passionate about. So that is how I decided to go to film school. That's great. Are you still doing that? um a little bit yes and no it's I don't know I'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years I've been uh producing like freelance producer what's your dream job that is so the question of the moment um I think that uh I don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but I know it's sort of what um I want and because basically like I've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and I know that that is like exhausting and I don't want to do that anymore so I'm looking for something that's stable um you know full-time nice benefits and um I definitely want to stay in the entertainment industry. And I like, you know, what I love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is going to get thrown at you. That's, you know, it's always interesting and exciting. So I'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where I can be reasonably challenged and, you know, have sort of a, like, room to, to grow and advance and all that. Yeah. I can't see your shoes. Um, I, I like to travel. Um, I don't know that, I haven't really been doing it a lot lately, but I have, you know, in the past done a fair amount. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love the adventure of it. Just, you know, new experiences, new places, new people. I think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just, you know, see beautiful, remarkable places and things and just experience different ways of living in different languages and different cultures um let's see I went to Costa Rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and I went for like 10 days and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time like it was really awesome but Costa Rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing zip lines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also I'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything what do I do to relax um I mean depending where I am like if it's you know if I'm like at work or something and I'm stressed out I just will you know kind of take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if I'm home I might just like you know throw on a movie or like a tv show that I really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief um pretty good I don't I mean it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often um the last time I argued with someone was my mom and it was about money um I felt really frustrated because I felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting yeah um it's good uh you know they live across the country for me so I don't get to see them that often, but, like, I usually talk to my mom on the phone probably, like, once a week. And my parents are really supportive. They are, you know, like, when I go back home to visit, like, I enjoy hanging out with them. We have a good time. So I'd say we have a pretty good relationship. That's good. What's something you feel guilty about? something I feel guilty about um I guess because I'm like in this sort of job hunting phase I feel guilty sometimes that I'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like I should have sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like I I feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough. Um, usually it's pretty easy. The last, the last couple of weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good. I'm not really sure. I haven't figured it out but um I've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um I've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like I wake up sometimes I wake myself up sometimes because I'm talking which is weird um so yeah it's just I don't know not that I have been able to identify I mean I guess maybe I'm like more stressed than usual just because like my job situation is like in flux but I don't know there was no like event cranky I value good sleep and I'm so I'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling. Um, not really. No. Yes. Um, like, I think in, like, October or November, although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago um i felt like i was really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it um just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah I just I wasn't really functioning normally yeah yes yes um sometimes more than others but yeah overall I would say so I think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like just like observing how I am like responding to certain situations and just I guess it's it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like kind of just reacting to situations. I'm like, just like noticing more what is going on. And it just helps to, I don't know. It's just helpful. I don't really know how to explain it. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I don't know it's probably not good that I can't think of I can't think of anything maybe over over Christmas being at home with my family yeah well it just was that was like I was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and like you know I live alone here I have a dog but so I just had a long period of feeling not great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kind of wishing that my family was around me. Um, so when I was there with them, it just, um, it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like, you know, warm familial embrace. um I think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener non-judgmental um i don't know is that enough okay um so this happened the the last like job that I had I mean I was it wasn't technically I was a freelancer but I was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh I had a very small company that had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of he sort of out of nowhere uh told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that I would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down in this conversation was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're like they're really cutting back like you probably noticed things are getting really slow and I was like yeah and he's like so I'm gonna I'm gonna have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but I was like okay and he went on to talk about how he I would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door. And, you know, because of that, he made it seem like, you know, even though I wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore, he would throw enough work at me still that like, I wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that I was making. Excuse me. But, and he was like, you know, this has nothing to do with the quality of your work. I love working with you. You're fantastic. Yada, yada. So to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road I um I had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when I was in there I saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that I was fired um and it was just like that the reason I would like if I could I would erase that from my mind is because I can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that's still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kind of like angry when I think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what I would um let's see I am a very loyal person um I am smart I'm organized I very like caring kind I'm conscientious and I work hard man I think to be more confident and less passive to really like focus on what I want and the things that I know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves probably just some of the relationships that I formed with people just like really you know deep friendships you're welcome bye Just like right before you walked in. Okay, good. Can I take this off? Yeah, you can take that off.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/374_P/374_AUDIO.wav,1
375,34,1," I'm in the right spot. animation and would love to learn about you, I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to talk to me.

I've been wanting to move anyways. Why? Just to get a change up. Everybody thinks LA is like, everything is the best, but it's too many people and too much traffic. I can't see your shoes. I can't see your shoes. Driving and seeing new stuff. last year I went to Sacramento from here and stayed out for like a month living in my VW bus with my wife it was kind of cool camping just wanted to have fun something different art Are you still doing that? No, a little bit. What's your dream job? Probably doing what you're doing. I'm really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too. Awesome. outgoing I haven't been doing much to do relaxing lately, but I like the beach. Good. I argued with my brother last night actually about him talking to me with more respect as a person I was mad I want to fight it's good but sometimes they're just they're too caught up and what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings like with my brother he's just he's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush it off on me What's something you feel guilty about? Have you done anything to avoid it? Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Something like probably taking some candy from the store. No, no. Taking money from my mom when I was like really young. Can you tell me about that? Well, I was like, I was in junior high school and I think I took like 20 from her purse and bought candy for my friends. I felt guilty though like the same day. Has that gotten you any better? Probably, yeah. That was probably the beginning of my stupid activities. All my life or in the past couple years? My wife. I'm married to her. We've known each other for about two years. I met her at an art walk she actually went to USC to the past couple days has been kind of hard but I usually go to sleep good I think I'm kind of, I think I'm snappy. Positive, optimistic. Yeah. I've been thinking more positively lately and I want to put a lot of stuff into action so I've been trying to train my mind into knowing that stuff is going to come to me speaking to the universe easy if you just try it do it everybody's got a spirit Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? Do you feel down? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Like what? Wanting to be positive and stay away from negative people. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? Being alive. Knowing God. How do your best friends love you? I don't know. I don't know.

No. Don't smoke cigarettes and watch how you spend your money? Are you going to sell my ideas and my thoughts? I can't think of anything. I don't know. Did it work that time? Yeah, it worked. She asked, or no, she said something about seeing, she said, as you can see from my shoes, I like to go hiking. And I said, I can't see your shoes.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/375_P/375_AUDIO.wav,0
376,40,1," I saw my hair. Everyone does that. You see what you look like and you're like, oh my god, I look terrible. So this picture is not based on a real woman at all? No, it's not based on an actual person. Okay. Yes. I'm doing okay. It's still morning, so. I'm from the East Coast, Massachusetts. Yes. When did you come to LA? I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. How does it compare to LA? LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA. In which back east, the east coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors, and to anybody that you see in the street. So, yeah. How do you think is it for you that you see it in LA? Well, since I was a kid, I was fairly young. At first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But after all that surpassed, I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. That's good. What are some things you really like about L.A.? Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach, so it's easy. Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not at all. Why? Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger. Went to Ensenada. But other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on lately. overseas actually child psychology and I was in the nursing program for a little bit but I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out that's right I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the 15 screensaver. Hey, I know it's not polite, but it's the best I've got. Yes. What do you do to relax? I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. Not good at times. I have some outbursts every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. What was the last time you argued with someone? Was there something you were struggling with? may be turned off from my personality because very opinionated and I say what I'm what's on my mind I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but I won't be bullied and I won't be made I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged so tell me about a situation that you wish you were in with your partner um Last year, my mother died. So, I wish I handled that differently. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? It upsets me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that will upset me more that is terrible sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like i can't i get up and then i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the tv and watch tv i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep um maybe because i do have a lot of my mind uh you know thinking about bills and and the stressfulness of work and all this other stuff so that's probably a big part of it. It's not difficult, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it just affects everything. Your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. so. I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like, leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Yeah. So other than that, um, I'm okay. Um, well, I've been, I've been depressed for quite some time and I'm still having difficulty because after my mother died four months later my uncle died so I had two deaths last year so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together I just recently I've started pursuing like interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I'm not getting much sleep. So sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Yes, I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago, probably 10 to 15 years ago, and it's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that, and I was feeling desperate and hopeless, and I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized and then uh they started treating me i started seeing a therapist so um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who had no some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist and I don't know if that's really going to help me. I mean, sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking, my god, what good is this? And the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions. Tools to help you deal with your emotions. So. um like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrists just medication um there's been no changes really i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and uh even though a lot of times i I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I would say when my son was born years ago. I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. So, and that was difficult as well. What would you say as an individual quality? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, even though sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. And, you know, those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. excuse me oh I have lots of regrets um uh things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about but um you know I met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. So, you know, you can't go back and make changes. It's too late. So why, you know, dwell on the situation? But sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. Right. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I mean, I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion. That's all. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating. after my mom died. I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot. You know, sleep, eat, sleep, eat. And so now I'm kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. How about something you did recently that you really enjoyed? I'm trying to think it's been a long time actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy I haven't been to a movie in ages I used to go out shopping all the time, I don't now so it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. How much time do you spend on your weekends? My weekends, like on Saturday, I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean-up day. You know, do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food, you know, that kind of thing. So it's not, if I was younger, you know, it would be fun, you know, go out clubbing or whatever but I'm too old for that now really there's nothing that I can think of there's nothing that I can be proud of What are some things that you do that you can't do? it. Okay. No problem. Thank you. Bye. Does somebody talk for her? Or is she just talking to me, really? I'll actually explain to you how she works once we're finished up with the study. Okay. You can actually take that headset off. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/376_P/376_AUDIO.wav,2
377,60,2," Okay. All right. Thanks. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, go ahead. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Wisconsin, and I lived in Colorado for a bit, and then I lived overseas for a little while, and then I moved to California. Wow. Mm-hmm. When did you move to LA? I moved here at the end of June of last year, so I guess it's been, what, eight months? Something like that. How often do you go back to your hometown? At the most, probably twice a year. How does it compare to LA? Well, my hometown is all of 5,000 people, and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms. So the opposite of LA. Why did you move to LA? That's a good question. I always wanted to live in California, but I had been living in the Central Coast. And I just had been coming down to LA like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff. So, yeah, things were changing in Santa Cruz for me. The client I had, who was really the main financial source I had, that relationship ended. So I was totally free to move. And I thought, well, I guess I'll give L.A. a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot, and here I am. How easy was it for you that you still lived in L.A.? No, not at all. It's a very, very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland, which is also a big city, but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. And yeah, so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging. And yeah. I love to travel I love it I lived in Ireland and I traveled I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica I spent some time in Mexico so yeah I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go I'd love to hear about one of your friends um sure well I guess I'm trying to think which was my favorite I mean there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both, but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days, and we went to three different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains, which are beautiful, and yeah, it's a really, really cool culture, so it was fun. What's one of your most memorable experiences? My trip to Ireland, I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there, so my most memorable moment of that trip, I mean, there's probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going just out to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is. I mean, it's, everyone sees pictures of Ireland or, you know, you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous, but you actually get there and experience it. Like, the pictures don't do it justice, so those are incredible. Awesome. Yeah. What did you study at school? I have an undergrad degree in English and psychology, and a psychology minor, and I have a master's degree in women's studies. Are you still working on that? No, I use my English and psychology. I work in marketing communications so I actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes into comes into play and so does my I guess my undergrad degree in English but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach um to because i'm not clear on the question um okay i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job Wow. You know, my dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who had not...she was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. I lived...my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. So, but I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've been, you know, cleared things up and have been in communication since then. That's good. How did you feel in that moment? well I'm not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah I'm shy. To relax, I do a number of things. I like to do yoga, although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery, actually, probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends I love art and trying new restaurants yeah all those things are both relaxing I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so yeah yeah How are you at controlling your hunger? Um, depends. If I'm driving, not very good. But otherwise, I'm pretty good at it. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Um, last time I argued with somebody? Probably would have to be... Oh, no, it was with the LA Times. About the newspaper delivery. Yeah, that was the last time. Can you tell me about that? Yeah. The newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of, it didn't show up. And I didn't realize that it wasn't there until late, I don't know, afternoon, I think early afternoon. and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10 30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so I mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah I was I was really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so I was angry with the LA Times I was angry with people who forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. Yeah, I was pretty frustrated. Oh, wow. There are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program and it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings, and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with. And then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach and that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and like I you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was I don't know so yeah I wasn't um I wasn't angry, I was just, I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment, and, you know, and I talked it out with her, and we got through it, but, yeah, I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time, and would have made the call go a lot smoother. the hardest decision wow there's been a few I guess moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging but the hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to, I chose to move to Colorado and that was a pretty tough decision because at that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived an hour, hour and a half And now they're going to be, you know, a 12-hour drive away or a plane ride away. So that was challenging. What made you decide to do that? Oh, lots of things. I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful, beautiful state. And the weather is so much better than Wisconsin. and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado so there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single that was another factor and were interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. So, yeah, and then I found a job that I liked. The pay was atrocious, but I found some work that was really rewarding, and so it all came together, and I chose to move. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, that's totally, I'm really no question. relatively easily. It just depends on like what time I go to sleep. If I'm out and I don't get home until 1130, then, you know, then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today. But generally I can sleep through the night. I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks. But even so, even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those, I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. Are they triggered by something? Yeah, I'm sure they are. I mean, I'm in another transition state. I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman. Yeah, and I just have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah how hard is that um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think I would have said yes to the situation. How have you been feeling lately? I feel trapped and helpless. I'm like, there's, you know, nothing I can, there's no way out of the situation that I'm in. No matter what I do, it doesn't get any better. I don't, you know, I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do, and my money's not working at all. So, yeah, it feels pretty crappy. I'm sorry. Thanks. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I have in the past, yeah. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, a long time. I was 15, I think, or 14, so it was over 20 years ago. What got you to see help? I was suicidal. Do you feel down? Oh yeah, I feel down. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't actually, no. Why did you stop? Well, I originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed and we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed. and then I began therapy again later on. I think it was in my early 30s. And then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland. Do you feel like there's a useful? Yeah, I mean, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention. I don't go into therapy thinking, oh, I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years. I think that's ridiculous. Right. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just that, not just creating a solution in that area, but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Wow. Huh. Wow, that's pretty sad. Um, it was at least a year ago. No, that's not true. It was when I saw my biological mother, which was last May. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities? I'm very strong. Very strong-willed. I am very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent. And, um, yeah. Is that anything you regret? Anything I regret? I don't think so. No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't take life too seriously. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Oh, my ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends, either going out at night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar, somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to a bar. And then I have brunch with friends and yeah, I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I am most proud of a few things. I mean, I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. And so I've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something, been dear to my heart to actually achieve those goals or those yeah I've done things that I've wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California that's great okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me sure goodbye I'm going to finish up with a quick post survey.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/377_P/377_AUDIO.wav,1
378,17,1," She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. Okay, great. So when she's done, she'll let me know. I'm going to put the doorbell over here. Hopefully it'll work, but I'll try to sometimes assist you with that. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to L.A.? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. At the beginning, the first few weeks were really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working in that? Nope. Why? Well it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just once I had done that work I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. Yep. My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday. Because I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international date line. and I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Shark's Bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and I got to be there for a whole weekend just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing it's just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world more shy why that's a good question um partly the first thing I think of is because I've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse I don't know I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people so I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live close to the beach, so that's one of my favorite things to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations, but not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. I don't know if I feel guilty about anything at the moment. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Not sure I have one at the moment. Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar, and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. I didn't know that I could do it. I wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. So that felt like a really difficult decision, but in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. at the time it was really difficult to do that. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment, so that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm like great, but it's because I am worried. But, you know, I'm also confident that things are going to work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either sort of like just a even keel well I get to go to the my friends work at the motion picture Academy so I get to see all the Oscar nominated movies She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again, so that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No. I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. What's next? Well, I just think that there are things that, like, it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. don't worry about the small stuff and save more money what are some things you wish you could change about yourself? well, you know, the normal things like I'd lose more weight and I would I think be a little more fearless, maybe Be a little more bold. I don't think I have any of those. Well, I am self-employed, so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself. And that I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that. And I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still want to do, but I feel like I've done what I said I was going to do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. yeah that's not so great well it's okay um both my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother um i feel closer to my brother than my sister but um they both live on the east coast and i live in la and then my sister has two girls so i feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers so they have other things on their mind probably my teacher a person i learned my holistic body work from i really like to model my work and my way of being after him. Like he's a good role model for me, the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? We're pretty close. We're not, you know, best of friends, but I do, I know that I can call him anytime I need him. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or, yeah, just spending time with my friends. Okay. Thanks. Bye. It worked again.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/378_P/378_AUDIO.wav,0
379,34,1," Okay. Okay. Cool. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious to talk to people and see if you can help. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions. And please feel free to tell me what you think. Your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. A little bit tired, but for the most part, feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I mean, I'm 23 now, so it's about, what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach, you know, not so much the traffic. Don't really care for that, but definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife, you know, just people in general. I like conversing with others, so, yeah. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes, but, yeah, actually, I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii, been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington, pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know, like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know, just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. Well, let's see, I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's, so that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean, you know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new different things, things that are unique. So, yeah. I actually study journalism right now. I'm in my final semester, so I'm about to graduate in a couple months. That's great. Yep. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into, like, business management, something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. You can almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. And, you know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. you know sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back other times I kind of it's not so much like I go into my shell but you know at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't I've never met them before so it's one of those things that kind of yeah you kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because you know I can neither be talk very talkative or at times you know I can be a little bit shy but you know, once I, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative, and so. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Um, you know, usually, um, I would listen to music, or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive, or, uh, you know, hang out with my friends, you know, just something to, just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit, you know, tense, and you just want to relax, and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy, so. You know, I've actually been better with that a couple years back, you know, there's points where, like, I pretty much couldn't control my temper, like, whatsoever, I mean, I would just pretty much get angry, you know, the littlest things, everything would just kind of tick me off, but, you know, I've, I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing, and, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see, I'm trying to think, it's, it was probably something with my family, with my mother, maybe, it's, I, I can't remember off the top of my head, but, you know, it's, it's always something so minuscule that, that's why I probably don't remember it, but, you know, eventually we make up, and I apologize for it, because, you know, I accept that I'm wrong in certain circumstances. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. That is the past, and I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing, just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. sees, he could be a little, you know, crazy, so, probably, like, you know, some sort of, like, traumatic stress disorder, maybe when he was in the military, so, I don't know, but, yeah. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back, been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old, so, it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with, but, you know, I try to, I don't, I don't, you know, try to keep in the back of my mind, but, you know, it's, it's always there. I don't, I don't ever forget, so, yeah. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm, I'm a pretty, pretty down-to-earth guy, usually pretty honest, sometimes brutally honest, but, you know, I try to work on that, too. you'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know, just normal activities like any other person, you know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. So, yeah. You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof, so you're putting in the new roofing, so that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning, so sometimes a little bit crabby, but for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism, so that's good. I've had to graduate in two months, so I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's good. Yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. It's not bad. Like I said, it could always be worse, but I'm enjoying life, so that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. no last time I felt really happy man you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had a sanity I guess you could say um you know he came back to visit from the Air Force he had some leave so you know we were just hanging out um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but I missed that you know so I felt great you know because there's nothing like having a best friend and you can have conversation you know 24 7 about anything you can tell anything to him in confidence and you can tell me anything in confidence like that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so yeah yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that I regret um well I mean I got a DUI about three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that I definitely regret because you know I look back on it and you know things might have been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances that took place so you know I'm manned up and, you know, I guess I think I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind. Like I said, it's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, you know, it's one of those things like I was a child then, so I really don't know what to say. I mean, even if I would have listened then, who knows. But, you know, I probably would have told myself, you know, just be careful, You know, make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can be. Basically, you know, just always be nice, be honest, just be caring toward others. Probably going back to my buddy with the whole paranoid schizophrenic thing. I don't say that I wish I could erase it. I just wish that it didn't happen like that. So, yeah. How often do you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend? I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends. Either, you know, we hang out in the day, you know, do certain things like, you know, maybe grab a few beers. You know, just have casual conversation. Maybe play games, watch movies. you know, just the standard stuff that people do, so. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Some things that I wish I could change? Um, probably just, you know, being nicer, like I said before. Um, maybe not being as lazy. Have more determination. I mean, I have quite a bit of determination. I know what I want to do with my life. But I know there are times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical, so I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Well, you know, it's tough to think back, but I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is, you know, I would say probably like when I was, you know, kind of getting angry at certain people, maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have. I was trying to give more constructive criticism, but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things, and they were out of character. Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities, I would say that I'm definitely hardworking, I'm determined, I'm very caring now, more than I used to be, very honest. and you know I just I love to talk to people like I like making new relationships I like making people laugh something that I did recently that I really enjoyed um you know it was probably over at my internship I was just you know I wrote a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're going to go into the paper. So I feel accomplished about that. You know, it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there, you know, it's right in your face and you can tell yourself, you know, like I did that. So it makes me feel good. Yeah. Um, you know, just, let's see a few different stories. It just usually thinks about, well, the paper's in Long Beach. So it's usually about, you know, stories or events that are taking place in Long Beach. So, yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? I would say that I'm most proud of, you know, graduating high school, about to graduate college. Hopefully, you know, obviously I'm going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a, you know, a good solid job, you know, in the near future. I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of. Thank you. I'm going to shut all the recordings down. And I'm just going to have you fill out a quick post survey about your experience. So we really value your feedback. So we really ask that you take care of your answers.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/379_P/379_AUDIO.wav,1
380,53,2," put it okay cool there I am All right. Thank you so much, Rachel. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming to the show. I just created a podcast before and I'm very excited to be an artist. I'm not a therapist, but I'm very wrong about people and I love hearing about people. I'll ask you a few questions before we start. And please feel free to comment on the video. The answers are very important. Are you ready for this? Sure. Okay. So, are you ready for this? I'm fine. I'm doing alright. Where are you from? I'm from Maryland. Really? Yeah. I'm from Maryland, Washington, D.C. area. When did it go away? Like five weeks ago. Wow. When did it go away? Maryland? Maryland? It's a lot less It's not as nice this time of year It's more It's good, it's nice LA is a lot better though It's a lot more people, a lot more going on I guess I'm still getting used to it So, um, it's, it's not like, um, yeah, I'm still getting used to it. It's, it's coming slowly, but, but surely. I live in Culver City. I do. I have one. Uh, it's okay. I live in a really nasty house. It's cheap because I'm living in a friend's place. And he's letting me stay there for half price. But the actual place itself is pretty horrible living conditions. But I'm moving soon, so. That's good. I'm sure you can tell them I'm seeing you. I'm not looking at world explore. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, actually. But no, I travel... I would say I probably traveled more than most people in the U.S., like, considering that most people don't travel in the U.S., but I wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy the chance to get to like see other, um, walks of life and, and, and kind of like meditate on the, the specificity of my own, you know, the, the, the, given the parameters that I grew up under, like how different everyone else is, like how, how every life is totally, I mean, even just within the U.S., like, seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up. And then to think about someone in, like, Thailand or something growing up, it's pretty amazing. Mm-hmm. I'd love to hear about what you think. Okay. Hmm. Putting me on the spot here, Ellie. um, let's see, uh, well, um, I, it's been a while since I've been on a trip, I guess one of the last trips I did was to, um, I mean, a lot, like, two years ago, I went on a road trip across the U.S., and that was, that was pretty amazing. I saw the, I guess the best, the best two places on the road. I drove from Maryland to LA. This is before I actually moved out here, but, um, I, I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole, like, even though it's part of the U S it's like a totally, it's totally different than anywhere else. It's so, um, unique. The culture there is so unique and the blend of, like, Caribbean and French and all these other influences into, like, the American South is so, so, um, uh, incredible. Yeah, it's just, it's, it's, yeah, it's unreal. Hmm. It's a tough question. What? I... I... Hmm. You know, I... Can you come back to that question? Are you capable of that? Yeah. Come back to it. Yeah. That's what I'm just saying. Film. You know, that's actually a question I've been asking myself. I know my entire life I've had, like, phases of interest. So when I was, like, very, very, very young, I was really into, like, the first phase that I remember was keys and then tools. Like, I would go around collecting keys, and then I'd go around collecting tools, like, just every sort of tool. I had a toolbox. My parents have told me that I had a phase before that which was balls, like, various balls. um and then I was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and instead like animals and then the dinosaur phase and at a certain at a certain point I got really into um like rap like music like first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there I I I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually I was going to be interested in, in, uh, film. Like I, I could kind of see the trajectory coming, but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion. I think I just always, I led a sheltered life. Uh, as far as movies are concerned, I didn't, my parents didn't let me see an R rated movie until I was like in high school almost like, um, and, uh, and I never, uh, so I never saw an R-rated movie, I was also very squeamish, like, I remember when I was fairly young, maybe, like, six, I saw Star Wars, the first scene of Star Wars, Darth Vader, crack, like, breaks a guy's neck, it's just a little scene, very, very, very beginning, and that, like, freaked me out, and I had to leave the room, so, I'm not really sure, yeah, it's I'm not exactly sure how I got into film, but I've always been fascinated by how people interact and what acting and stuff and movies in general. I am, yes. um, to be a filmmaker, to be able to direct and, uh, put, put together and make, like, I guess direct, I don't use that word so much because I think, I think of it more as, like, I want the opportunity to put together and make movies, uh, or to make movies is probably the best way to do it, uh, to say it because I want, you know, I want involvement in all the, all the processes, but, I guess the best parable for that would be a director. Director. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, it's a lot better when I'm not living with them. My... I guess... It's funny you should ask, Ellie. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I think I'm close... in my entire family, I'm closest with my dad. Um, I get along with my brother and sister, you know, like, but I don't went away. Like my brother's in a foreign country right now. So I don't have the opportunity to talk with him, but like, I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else. Cause I feel like he's the most, like of all my family, he's the one who most accepts me and like um thinks positively about me um so it's i have like a a complicated relationship with my parents i mean my family in general well on the Myers-Briggs personality test I'm I'm an extrovert but like since moving but I'm not like I'm not I probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion or on the scale of extroversion, sorry, I would consider myself extremely introverted. I just, I see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around, they're able to like strike up conversations. And I'm a fairly shy person. I'm sort of like, or inhibited person maybe. So I like to like, until, yeah, but I'm working on it. I'm working on it. Okay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I can only fix things for my favorite. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Chris, what do you do to relax? Um, well in the past I would smoke weed, but I've quit smoking weed. So now I, you know, have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie. I don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an if it's if it's a worn out sort of stress like I like then I that's what I do but if it's a more like anxious type stress I might go on an intense walk don't really exercise that much but I like you know competitive sports and hiking pretty good well I always like arguing um I wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper um i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um but i don't as long as my like because i won't like revert to personal you know attacks uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject um and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating because i'm not like the best articulator of what I think. One of my weaker points, I would say. But the last time I had a heated debate, I think, was that the question? What happened? I forget the question. That I had a heated debate? the last time I had a heated debate was, um, I had a heated debate about, uh, the movie Boogie Nights. Um, I, I didn't lose my temper exactly, but I get like very extremely passionate about, about, cause I, I don't think it's like that good of a movie, but the two people who I was, I was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best, um, best movies. Why did they think it was the best movie? Um, they think that like, there's some, there's some sort of, as I understand it, they have, um, they have a certain, uh, uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like um what were they saying they were saying like the movie it's like, it's like the end of an era, which makes it kind of like casino, and there's this attention to detail of, of, of the, in the different character, like, how they, how they interact in the plot, um, kind of like, uh, yeah, I guess, I think the heated debate became about, like that so from there and like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's the um i just don't think dirk digler is like that like me meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie because i had seen it before many years ago and my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like in watching it again i was able to re-evaluate it um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable about this solid acting, the directing is good, the camera moves are cool it's cool but for me it was meaningless and then that led us to discuss, because the movie that I saw recently that I really did like was Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme, I guess the heated part of the conversation came about Like so in the movie Django Unchained, you have Django and Django is like a kind of he's a two dimensional character. But I don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is. And you have Dr. King Schultz, who's this who's this like his mentor character. And the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent. and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would have risked his life to save jango or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh plantation to to save jango's wife etc and um and the reason the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themselves for someone else. Um, which, which strikes me as so like, um, like who, uh, like she, she, her, her basic argument was that like altruism doesn't exist. It was a very Ayn Rand type argument. Altruism doesn't exist. um the only the only thing you can do is like the only thing people do is serve themselves um so it's not quite Ayn Rand but it's like the only thing that like all people are out to serve themselves which I'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism in and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in and and like what, but what, how, how horrible is your life if that's, like, what your ultimate, um, like, if you, if you can't, like, love and sacrifice for other people, so it led it to an extremely, uh, passionate debate, um, and, uh, so much, like, yeah, and it's, uh, so, um, so, yeah, that that I guess that's the I don't think I necessarily like lost my temper um I think of losing my temper as being more um like I just I I would revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but I I didn't like that's not um maybe I was like maybe I was criticizing her world view But I wasn't like, well, you're an idiot. You know, like it wasn't, it didn't turn into abuse of any sort. Yeah, I'm glad you understand. An event or, I don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory. I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like. I remember feelings and moments, not stories. Like my life doesn't always sync together into like a coherent story. It's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment. So, yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. oh jeez could it just be one of the hardest decisions hmm um choosing between two things that it's like I guess I'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I like had to choose between two options like no there's no like Sophie's choice type moment in my life but I do think that the decision because I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult but I had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all my core group of friends were either like where most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then uh the one other person i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't i was either going to live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i think it was a tough decision to to leave i in fact it was so tough that the only way I could do it, I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York within like a month or two, uh, which wasn't, which didn't end up happening, but that was the only way that I could leave New York. It was, how hard was that? Or how hard is, how hard was that? um it was hard um it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating ice because also like i had fought like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and uh that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her it was wasn't quite like her me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i didn't like you know just being socially isolated etc yeah well recently it's been awful I I like to so the last last night I slept for like ten and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep um because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um too much riled up energy or something i don't know tired uh very not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days, but before the last two days, I hadn't had any coffee in, like, three and a half weeks, so, um, I guess with, with caffeine in my system, I'm ready to, I'm ready to go, um, without caffeine, it's, I'm just, I'm just quieter, I guess, more introverted. since like lately as in when um changing my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to because I moved here because I have a group of friends here or a couple of friends I don't have like a large number of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first, and I think that I'm slowly coming to terms with that and moving past it. But it's still there. The pressure is there, but I'm just, you know. You know. You know. No, I just didn't. Nope. The last time I felt really happy. Might have to reach back. I think the last time I felt really happy was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie um co-wrote co-directed co-produced um and that was kind of like that it still consumes my life but um but i think that during the writing stages of that movie in which we would like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative for energy um between me and the person writing it and and there's like probably like a good day that I remember where it's just I remember going to bed and I was just so thrilled to be working on what I was working on and and working with the person I was working with and like just like I felt like yeah I guess that was the last time that was that was like more than a year ago though but I guess it's hard to hard to think that I haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with with like can't like you can't there's too much else to do so i would say that i'm very except like accepting of other people and always i'm very empathic um and open like excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. less ruled by fear, more fearless in my everyday interactions and in my zest for living. um yeah i i other things i would change about myself i i would i don't know hmm really badly about myself um I think there are numerous instances in my childhood in which my, like, uh, like, every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of, um, some sort of, uh, conflict with a teacher or anything, my parents were always, always on the other side of the court, you know, like never, it was, I noticed or noticed as I got older that other people, other parents were like, if their kid was in trouble, like there's something wrong with, with like their kid was perfect. There's something wrong with other people. But my parents were, it was always the opposite. Um, and particularly my mom. So I would say that there are a couple of instances in which, um, I was, like, blamed or, like, you know, it was my, it was my fault, um, when, when, what I was doing, like, yeah, it's just things, things that I couldn't, like, there's no, yeah, I don't know. Yeah. 10 years ago um stay steak you know like I I think that there's um I have a tendency to like I love the fact that I have a tendency to get really caught up in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes um ideas are too easily just I would just say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you um are only going to do one thing um try to like i guess i would have taken up like some taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums would have been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes um as far as like because i was always really into directing, so I was always directing actors and stuff, but I didn't, it's only now that I, um, I don't know, I guess stay, uh, don't stay, stay, stay, yeah, I don't know, that's a tough, tough, tough question, Ellie. That's it? Sure. Goodbye. Bye. All right. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/380_P/380_AUDIO.wav,0
381,49,2," Okay, thanks. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. Okay From Santa Monica Really? Really? What are some things you really like about LA? The people, mostly What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, the people, also No, not a lot. Well, I can't afford to travel as much as I'd like to. I was an English major. How did you decide to do that? Are you still doing that? I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? How hard is that? Oh, it would be pretty much impossible for me. Why? I don't have any experience in that field. I understand. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm very shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I play music. What do you do when you're annoyed? What do I do when I'm annoyed? I don't know. What do I do when I'm annoyed? I can't think of anything. I don't know. I don't think... Yeah, I don't do anything specifically. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. I would say very good. I don't lose my temper very often. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? When was the last time I argued with someone? I can't remember. Yeah, I don't have a lot of conflicts with people. I can't remember the last time I argued with someone. Well, let's see. when I was a little kid I was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and I saw it well I saw it when when the robbers were leaving yeah maybe I would want to erase that from my memory if I could How did you feel in that moment? Well, I didn't know what was happening in that moment, so I didn't feel so bad at the time, but I felt bad afterward because then, you know, my mother was upset by it. My mother was there and she had to call the police and it was, it was disturbing to see her, you know, really disturbed that way. But at the time that it actually happened, I wasn't really upset. It was more the aftermath of it. That sounds really hard. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Situation? I don't know. Well, I can think of a... There's probably a million situations that I would have, which I would have handled differently. I can't think of one in particular. Maybe, maybe, I think that when I was a kid, I, well, I think that when I was, let's see, Oh, I have, okay, I have a good one. I didn't marry the girl that I think that I should have married. So that's a big one for me. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, well, we were together for about four years and I think I just took her for granted and I just didn't commit. And that was a long time ago. And now that it's been so many years, I realize, well, I don't know if it's a realization, but I think now that, yeah, she should have been my wife, that we were meant for each other or made for each other. But because my selfishness and because I just had this fear of commitment at the time, I just felt like I didn't do what I should have done, what the smart thing would have been. What's something you feel guilty about? Well, the last thing I can think of that I would say I feel guilty about was... You know, I feel a lot of guilt about my friendships. I don't feel like I'm as good of a friend as I could be, but then at the same time I don't really know exactly how I could be a better friend. I just feel a little guilty that I can't help people. Anyone who has a problem, I can't. I never feel like I can help anyone who I know who has a problem. When was the last time that happened? Oh, that happens every day. I guess that happens with everyone who I know and everyone... All of my relatives and all of my friends, I don't feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, they're... It's very distant. It's just... It's very cordial and it's very... I don't know what the word is. It's on the... It's kept at a very surface level. I don't think that they know... I don't think that my family really knows me very well at all. And I don't know them very well either. Not in a true sense. So... Yeah, I think a lot of families are that way, but it does bother me that mine is that way. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, it's very easy. I sleep a lot, and I have no problem sleeping at all. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, not really. I would say the way I am now, it's the way I think I've been my whole life. So even when I was a little kid, I slept a lot also. No, I don't think I've changed much. How have you been feeling lately? I'm pretty down. But like I said, in a way I could say, yeah, I'm feeling really down. But then again, I've always been this way. So it's hard to say that it's down when it's consistently that way. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, a long time ago. I was about 10 years old, around there. What got you to seek help? I was just missing a lot of school. I didn't want to go to school, so eventually they sent me to a therapist, and then to a psychologist, and then to a psychiatrist, and it went from there. Do you still go to therapy now? No, I haven't gone to therapy since I was a teenager. Why did you stop? Well, I didn't feel it was helping me at all. So one day I just decided I didn't want to go anymore. How has seeing a therapist affected you? Well, like I said, I didn't feel that it helped me. So I guess it, I don't know that it affected me much. No I wouldn't say disturbing, no. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. That's great. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be, I would probably be traveling. I would really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend. Going anywhere really, just anywhere out of the city. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go. I really do think people are different when you go to different places and how they interact with you and how they see the world, different food. And I also like historical places. I'm into history and I enjoy just visiting anywhere that has some sort of historical significance. Awesome. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I haven't taken a trip in a long time. The last trip I really took was, I went to France a few years ago for a wedding. And I had a really good time there. I had always wanted to go to Paris and so I got to go to Paris and then I went to a little town that's a few hours away from Paris where the actual wedding was. And yeah, it was really fun. I think the church where the wedding was was a thousand years old. Wow. Yeah, it was a really cool trip. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I don't know. I don't know what would be considered memorable. Whatever comes to your mind. A memorable experience. Probably the most memorable experience, I guess, would just be nothing in particular, but living with a girl who I just, who I told you earlier that I think now that we should have gotten married. That's something that stays in my memory. why I'm saying it's memorable because it's still with me and it's something that I don't think you know well I know I'll never forget but it's not any particular day or any particular moment Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, a lot. I wish I could be healthier, for one thing, more energetic, and more friendly. Well, I think I am pretty friendly, but more outgoing, more social. So those two things mainly, I guess, I would like to be more social, more enthusiastic, and healthier. How would your best friend describe you? That's a good question. How would my best friend describe me? I think he would say that I'm a very, well, it sounds cheesy, but he would probably say that I'm a very spiritual person and that I'm very giving. I think I'm a lot more selfish than people think I am, but people think that I'm not selfish. and probably he would say that I'm creative also what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago well my advice to to myself I don't understand the question Is there anything you regret? Yeah, but we already talked about it. Right. What are you most proud of in your life? No, I can't... Well, I don't think that I really believe in being proud or in pride. I don't think that accomplishments are really something to be proud of, but I can't really think of any accomplishment anyway, even if I did have something to be proud of. I can't think of any sort of accomplishment I've had. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something I did recently that I really enjoyed. Well I sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine. I don't usually do that but yeah, that was a lot of fun a few days ago. Cool. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. It was more difficult than I thought it was going to be. She just kind of had me stumped a lot of the time. And then I was, I think I got better after a little while. And I was, yeah. At first I thought, oh, they're going to get mad because I'm not saying anything and I don't know how to answer. We appreciate you coming in. You can actually take your headset off now.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/381_P/381_AUDIO.wav,1
382,19,1," Good job on that. Alright. Okay, cool. I just created a podcast for people in the space and in the spirit of humanity. I'm not a therapist, but when you're learning about people and you love learning about you, I'll ask you a few questions before we start. And please feel free to send me a message. Your answers are absolutely comfortable. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Columbia, South Carolina. Really? Yep. When did it go in? 2004. That's a long time. Yep. How often do you go back to your hometown? Once a year for Christmas break. That's good. How does it compare to a leg? A lot slower paced. I wanted to pursue a film degree, or I'm sorry, a film career. Yes. It's pretty challenging, but it's fun. I've always had an interest in film and movies, so it seemed like a natural pick for me. How easy is it for you to get used to it in LA? What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you don't really like about the U.S.? I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I've never been outside of the US but I would love to at some point. It depends on the situation. I can either be introverted or extroverted just given the right circumstance. What do you do to relax? How long do you think it comes from? When was the last time you argued with someone? debate but it was pretty pretty tame I think it was a debate over sports over about a basketball game and I was talking on Facebook with somebody about it but I think it's good to express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh it's natural to you know not always agree on things so I think I think talking about it is healthy. That makes sense. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a very good relationship with my family. I get along with all of my family members and extended cousins and aunts and uncles. So there's no one that I've ever had any rifts with. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you would see a different man. Hmm. With my family? Hmm. I probably could have been more disciplined growing up and more disciplined with schoolwork and homework and that kind of thing. But for the most part, I had a good childhood and there's not much I would change about it. Okay, tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm, probably leaving my comfort zone in South Carolina and moving out here. That was pretty hard, but at the same time it was exciting. So it was a bittersweet feeling. A lot of excitement mixed with some anxiety, but it went away pretty quickly. Are you happy with your life? Sure. Okay. What is something you feel guilty about? Have you done anything to avoid it? Have you had someone that's been a positive influence on you? family support system and parents and siblings so that's definitely a positive thing event Probably going back to school. I wish I would have done better in school. So if I could take something back from my past, it would be scholastically related. Okay. How easy is it to even get a good history? It's pretty easy. When I don't sleep well, I tend to be kind of lackadaisical and just tired throughout the day, kind of groggy. No, everything's pretty much the way it usually is with me. I've been feeling pretty good. No, I have not. No, I haven't. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy, I made a lot of money a few weeks ago and I feel like I'm ahead of the game with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here. I'm still kind of having the lingering effects from that happiness. That's great. Can you say a little more about that? When I have money, I tend to be a lot more even-tempered. Not even-tempered, but I tend to feel better about things and more optimistic. And this city being such about your finances, it always makes me feel good to be ahead of the game. And to have sources of income. What would you say is something that's coming? I think I'm creative, and I think I'm a good listener. What advice would you give yourself to have a good time with your kids? To be as disciplined and focused as possible, because once you're out of your parents' homes and out of their lives, you have to depend on yourself. And the better you do in school, the better you are. as far as discipline is concerned, the more pleasurable your life will be and your life will be a lot easier. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Let's see here. I wish I was more... disciplined but I'm working on that and I've gotten a lot better at that it's become pretty easy I think I'm just getting older I'm out of my 20s now so I definitely seen a change from when I first came out here some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was not feasible and kind of a pipe dream. So that kind of made me feel bad. But I kind of take insults in stride. And sometimes I welcome constructive criticism because some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of. So as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place, I think it could be an invaluable tool, you know, listening to what other people have to say that might be negative. How would your best friend describe you? Probably optimistic and outgoing, optimistic and helpful. Okay. How would you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend? I would love to go to Vegas and have a road trip with three or four friends, packed in the car and just lots of disposable income and good weather. When was the last time you were home? I haven't been to Vegas in probably five years, but I've gone to casinos with my brother and that's pretty fun sometimes. Nice. What are you most proud of in life? That's so good to hear. What are some things that you would be doing now? That's good. Tell me about something that you think you would really enjoy. I had a friend over at my apartment and I watched a movie and that was fun. It was a documentary. Sure. Goodbye. Goodbye. All righty. Cool. Okay. That's an advanced system. It's funny, I would say something and it would be, you know, I don't know how to respond to it. I don't know how to respond to it.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/382_P/382_AUDIO.wav,0
383,28,1," This is kind of fun. I hope so. Did you need to do like a mic check or are we good? We're good. So now she's going to ask me some things. Okay. Once she's done, that's the second. Cool. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people in a very, very different environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm really learning about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions before we start. And please feel free to contact me. Your answers are very, very important. Are you okay with this? Yeah, I'm totally fine. It be confidential or not, you know. My words are everybody's. Get wild. That's good. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good, hanging out, nice weather, um, I just had a recent change of feeling just now, looking at you, the digital you that I'm seeing, uh, I don't know, it's, yeah, it's funny, Why? I think... Where are you from originally? What are some things you really like about LA? that the idea of certain medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent topic, very thought upon. And I feel that Los Angeles' deep culture is why I stay here and pursue my art, because there's a lot to gain from the different communities, if you understand. What are some things you know that you're going to do on the way? You know, this, yeah, it's a very, it's a very hectic atmosphere, human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting, loving community to help each other out kind of thing. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Well, I can't see your shoes, but I love to travel. I do love hiking. I do love surfing, swimming, biking, riding, taking rides. I do love to travel, yeah. What do you enjoy about traveling? Um, from my travels, it's not like, well, I do enjoy a lot of things about travel, but it's more like, what do I, it's just more like, I enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints. I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this faux image, you know, man-made image that it is here. So I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is. That's great. Thanks. I'd love to do that on the trip. Would you? Okay. Um, well, I, um, kind of recently last year went to Los Banos, Central California area. And although it wasn't that far from LA, it was completely different energy. Um, there was no phones, there was no wifi, there was no TV. there was there was sanity there was relative sanity in the sense that people weren't deluded and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chillin I was working at a hot spring resort and I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot carpentry. How hard is it? Not hard. You don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy. So it wasn't. What made you decide to do that? I guess kind know what I described about this city I just wanted to get out of here and kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal yeah What did you study at school? animations, dance productions, theater productions, stuff like that, yeah, it was cool, it was fun, trippy, very trippy, um, but it was cool, but I had to leave that because tuition hikes up to, you know, going up to, like, 50,000 a year for, like, a four-year BFA is, uh, not, not the deal, I'm not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans. So, yeah. Hey, that's not a good word. Sucks. What's your dream job? Dream job. Hmm. My dream job would be anything that I can do to alleviate these metropolitan cities from the nightmare that they've been put in. My dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world. And with, you know, physical therapy and artistic expression, I've got some great ideas. Yeah. That's good. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I guess more outgoing I just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver Hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best they've got What do you do to relax? I thought that was really funny What I do to relax is just kind of breathe it out, chill, maybe make a smoothie or some tea. I'm going to go bike riding. Right there. How are you at controlling your hunger? Pretty good, I guess. I haven't yelled in a long time. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? from New York and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written. Yeah, so yesterday. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. Guilty... That's tough, I haven't had that feeling in a long time. Guilt... What about you? What's something you feel guilty about? Why don't we talk about that later? Mm-hmm. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Mmm... I don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory because then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased, you know, butterfly effect kind of like, yeah. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. Hmm. Um, maybe the time... Um, she was going to school, I was taking the year off, and I was just kind of hanging around. Um, but we had an apartment together with another friend. And it didn't turn out, you know, not all... Well, nothing turns out as it's thought to be, and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it, but this one turned out a little different, actually quite different than I thought it would be. I thought it was funny, but yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended. And it actually ended up, yeah, with us separating. But that's something I wish maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision? Hmm. Hmm, maybe, maybe not the hardest, but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school, dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA. Yeah, that could have been the hardest. What made you decide to do that? Um, it's just, uh, I don't, I mean, of course, money, money's the motto, money's a big issue, tuition hikes going around the whole nation, not a fan of that, not a fan of, not a fan to support that, but, um, yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around. But another reason why I decided to leave, I had to make a hard decision to decide to leave, was also because Art Institute, you know, that's a funny idea in itself already. And basically I was a musician, being taught by a musician to make music and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theater students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and it's just um Yeah, it's just not quite as artistic as I thought art would be. Art comes from somewhere sweet and deep and purple, and not from out there, you know, so, yeah. Okay.

386,24,1," now oops might have pulled something Great. Thanks so much. Thank you. I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Oh, I'm fine. I'm a little tired, but I found out my thyroid is, I think, acting up, so... Uh-oh. Where are you from originally? I was born in Canada, but I've lived in California most of my life. And it's gray today, too, so the gray weather makes you kind of sluggish. When did you go back to L.A.? Oh, my gosh, years and years ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. I don't think I've gone back there for a long time. Well, the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years. Gas prices have gone up. So travel, as much as it's a fun thing to do, it's cost prohibitive. How does it compare to LA? Oh, let's see. Everything has pluses and minuses. Cold weather. Not as much sun. So I think I'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather. But other than that, it's very pretty back there, natural scenery. But I like it here. You know, the traffic's kind of heavy, but that's a small thing to deal with. Why did I move to L.A.? Because my family came here and started. My dad got a job here, and this became our home base. And that's why. How easy is it for you to get used to living in LA? Easy, very easy. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, in high school you generally study general ed. They have designated courses. And then after that, went to college and I was a business major. Let's say I was a veterinary major. And I graduated with a degree in liberal arts. What made you decide to do that? I don't know. I can't really pinpoint why. Okay. Are you still working in that? I was working in social services, but I've also worked in sales, and most recently I'm doing real estate. I'm a leasing consultant part-time. Are you happy you did that? I mean, everything has pluses and minuses. It's okay. It's not, I don't really see too many negatives. What's your dream job? Oh, probably to work as a gossip columnist at TMZ or one of those networks. But as you know, everything in the entertainment business is very competitive. It's who you know, so. But that would be my dream job or probably working with cats, you know, animals. Yeah. So. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm very outgoing. In fact, I think I'm so outgoing I scare people sometimes. There's a lot of quiet, you know, reserved people out there. So I'm kind of East Coast, very, you know, I go up to people and talk to them. I'm very social. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Oh my gosh, I could do hundreds of things. I could read, I could watch a show, turn on the music. Music is great. Take a walk, call my friends, a million things. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I'm very good. I mean, you know, of course when you're driving in LA and somebody Cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating, but I'm I'm actually pretty I'm not the type of person that will fight Or yeah, I don't like to have confrontations. So I Can't really remember so as I said, there's not very many arguments usually I I avoid arguments at any cost. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? I don't really feel guilty about anything right now that I can think of. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I can't think of anything right now. I really can't think of any decisions that were really hard it's pretty easy for me to make a decision so I don't have a family I had to move to San Francisco for a job once but since I'm single I don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing. So it kind of makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider. That makes sense. Yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. An event? Hmm. Well, obviously you don't, you know, the passing of a family member, you know, you wish everybody could be around forever. So I know when my father died, you know, I mean, I wish I would have had him for a lot longer. I mean, he died at the age of 77, and, you know, it would have been nice to have him around a little bit more. But, you know, can't control those things. Life has its own way of dealing with that. There are always great options, aren't there? Yes, there are. Yin and yang, that's ancient philosophy, and it really applies. There's pluses and minuses and negatives and positives. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, as I said, my dad's no longer here, and my mother and I, you know, we have our differences. I think mothers and daughters always do. My brother and I get along great. I see him a lot. My sister works a lot. I see her, and, you know, we talk, and she's kind of got her own life, and her children, I get along great with them. so we have a small family once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids out there I think majority of them seem to be pretty well behaved I mean you know there's always going to be children that are kind of out of control but I don't know the ones that I've seen recently they're very well behaved so can't say much else about that well I live in an apartment and I don't know if you've ever lived in an apartment but there's someone that lives above me I'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of I guess they have lots of energy. They usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall. So it sounds like Niagara Falls in there and so I don't, yeah, and I need eight hours of sleep and I've only been getting, oh, I'd say like maybe six hours and then I usually wake up once at night too because sometimes they'll, kind of around two or three in the morning, they'll either walk around or I'll hear something so I'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely but there's not like I said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know I mean the ladies are very quiet it's just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers washing clothes at night that's I can't say anything to her about that Yeah, but you know, there's people that are in worse situations, so I don't make a lot out of it, you know, and I just, it's not like every night, but it's, you know, at least twice a week, so, you know, I've considered maybe sleeping in another room, but for now, you know, that's, I'll deal with it, so. What are you like when you don't sleep well? tired, very tired and hard to focus, hard to concentrate. It just takes me longer to get things done because I don't have my energy. Also, I haven't been exercising. I normally try to walk about half an hour a day, but the weather's been kind of colder and kind of drearier, so, you know, I'm not as motivated when the weather's kind of blah, so it's a combination of both, not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep. how have you been feeling lately uh as i said before i'm tired i'm it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we have been having very gray days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin I need that. I'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because, you know, whatever. And I think my thyroid is acting up too, so that's kind of creating, you know, I have some vitamin deficiencies. And, you know, once the sun comes out, I'm kind of more energetic. It just gives you that more energy. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. I'm happy most of the time I'm a pretty happy person and I like to be around other people I mean of course I like my private time but I do like being around people quite a bit so hmm I can't think of anything right now. I mean, I usually enjoy everything I do. There's nothing that stands out more than anything else. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No, I never regret anything. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice would I have given? Well, I guess, yeah, I could probably change things around. I think everybody could. I probably would have had a different college major. You know, it seems like, what else? I probably wouldn't have dated certain men, wasted time with certain people. I don't know. Those are the things that come to mind. maybe started saving money earlier those types of things but outgoing lots of fun to be with just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend I'm loyal, trusting I listen, I'm a good listener I'm very patient as well so that's good what are some things you wish you could change about yourself well number one would be to lose weight but i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know it's just easy to real it's so easy to relax. It's hard to get up and move around. You have to talk yourself into it. The weight gives you more energy, too, if you lose weight. So that's a big thing as well. But that's probably the thing, just the weight thing. I understand. How would your best friend describe you? I think you might have asked me that question before. But if you want, I'll repeat it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm very, like I said, I'm very loyal. When I tell people I'm going to do something, I do it very reliable. I'm warm. I'm very friendly. I'm a great listener. And I've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me. So like I said, I'm pretty upbeat. I don't let things get me down too much. What are you most proud of in your life? Hmm, that's a hard question. I can't think to answer that one. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun, well, I love movies. I could see every movie that they make. I love going out with my friends, shopping, swap meets. My gosh, traveling is great, road trips. That's kind of, you know, part of it, yeah, that I mentioned. What do you enjoy about traveling? Traveling, getting to see different places, the history aspect of it, the foods, enjoying foods in different countries, the architecture. It's just kind of neat to get away and see a completely different place. Yeah. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Okay, well, I've been to a lot of places in Europe. I love Paris. It's such a walking city. You can, whoever designed that city, I'll tell you, I mean, you can get from one point to another. The subways are great. Each area has its own distinctive kind of, there's the Latin Quarter where the students are. There's another area where, let's say, the fashion designers are, kind of like our Rodeo Drive here in Beverly Hills. There's an area that is more African, and they have swap meets on the weekends that are wonderful. It's very international. Then, like I said, once you get out of Paris, there's just so much history you can go see. Versailles, there's other palaces. You can go to the south of France. That's probably my favorite country. I've been to Italy, as well. Wow. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, well, after college, people usually, I mean, people that go to college, or either before or after college, that's a great time to go to Europe, because you're young and you're not tied down, you don't have a family, and you kind of have a more adventuresome spirit. You got more energy, so carrying, you know, backpack or suitcases is not a big deal. deal so yeah that's thank you goodbye Oh, that was fast. There wasn't any, like, shocking questions. You're expecting worse? Yeah. Never know, I guess. Exactly. Well, I'm going to go ahead and stop that recording and head on over.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/386_P/386_AUDIO.wav,0

Frequently I've been back there quite a bit, but over the years not that often. How does it compare to LA? Well, it's a whole different experience. I go back there to see my family and old friends. So L.A. is home. It's nice to return here. That's good. Why do you live in L.A.? To be an actor. Are you still doing that? I'm just actually getting around to it. I was in another business for 25 years and now finally I can't put it off anymore. What made you decide to do that? The economy.

When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? job hunting and like that it's it's difficult she we're very different and and I have very different MOs. And so for me to do things my way is not always easy. So, well, just the other night I was performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to introduce myself to a very famous person and I didn't do it. Why? I'm not sure. I guess I didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him. I'm sorry. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I can't think of one. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I've been married for, I'll be 24 years in July, which is a couple of months. And my wife and I have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years. But we have a very high-achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school this spring. bring and she's just gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice scholarship. That's great. Mm-hmm. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Yeah. Yeah, well, my daughter's been very low maintenance for me, perhaps more so for my wife, but she's always been an excellent child. What are some ways that you're different as a parent from your parents? Well, we're more similar, I think, than different. I'm much more aware of what's happening in the world and much more informed than my parents were. But in terms of child rearing, I think we've all been kind of hands-off, and my wife has been more hands-on. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Well, the financial responsibility, wanting to make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and not wanting her to not have the same as her friends. and she has very wealthy friends. I am not a gifted moneymaker. So it's a struggle, but we keep up.

What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, I cope pretty well. I guess I'm just not quite as functional as I'd like to be. There are a couple of nights a week when I work until 2 o'clock in the morning and don't get to bed until 3. And then I... Normally, I need 7 hours. If I only get 5 or 6, then I'm sluggish. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Um, very anxious. Can you tell me about that? Well, um, I have big, um, I have bills to pay and not a lot of income coming in. That sounds really high. Yeah, it's because I don't like to fall behind. I feel like I'm worried about losing ground, and the stakes are high. and so it's an uncomfortable position. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I am a classic depressive and yeah I guess I have I guess I have I do see a therapist and though the therapist I'm seeing now is not trying to prescribe drugs or medications. Previous ones have. How long ago were you diagnosed? Probably six years ago. What got you to see a doctor? Well, my wife kind of pushed me into it. She thought it was a way of, I think, getting help finding work.

Oh, just kind of not wanting to face the day, just kind of wanting to, just kind of a weariness with the struggle, and just a displeasure with my life. Yes. Their what? I don't understand that word.

That's so good to hear. Is there anything you wrote? No, except meeting that one woman. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? probably try a little harder. I had started this business around that time and it was just it was difficult but we were successful at it and I guess I could have gotten it rolling even more so that it wouldn't be so dead today Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Oh, um, getting out of town, going, going away when, when, which is rarely possible. What are you most proud of in life? Well, my daughter is a great source of pride. and the fact that I've been pretty successful in my endeavors, and now I'm just going for the big apple. And I hope to be successful there too.

I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. so I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background, so I wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard. It was a passion, so I enjoyed it. Are you still working on that? I'm not, no. What's your dream job? To do photography full-time, and also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively, more creative things. Like what? I have an idea. I'd like to do, make some, like a robe line, women's robes and things like that. Awesome. Mm-hmm. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've traveled quite a bit, and I love travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people, all of that. And the language. I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there and moved around to different parts of Greece and really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there and going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to El Afonisos in a car with everybody and having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with, and as I get to know people, then I'm much more outgoing. What do you study at school? Photography and language studies. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I just stay at home. Maybe watch a movie, rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed, that's probably one of the things I like to do to relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think very good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? It was probably with my boyfriend regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now and financially it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds very hard. Yeah, it has been difficult, but I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? So, while I'm here and I'm doing this focus study, I'm doing many things to generate more money working harder, but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my career. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably being raped. No. No. Sometimes. Not that I'm aware of. I've been feeling stressed. I've been feeling stressed and worried. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't seem to have any problem with it. I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm grumpy and lethargic in the morning. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Hmm, a situation I wish I would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision that I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? Well, I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. And that was also due to financial burden. And the father who I was involved with did not want the child. So I made that very, very difficult decision. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Really, really happy. I know when I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year, New Year period, New Year holiday. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. I would say I'm a wonderful, wonderful friend. When I love somebody, I love them very deeply. friends, family, boyfriend. So I think that's good. I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. So I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life, you know, forever. Mostly out. So that's not fantastic but it's something that I'm used to so it's not as painful as as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. But it's still not the best situation. I mean, I still wish that could be remedied somehow. So there's good and bad relationships in my family. Has someone else been a positive influence in your life? I have someone that's been there for me since I was very, very young and has always been just incredible and I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Ten or twenty years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now. Okay. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy. That was probably a great time, one of the best times in the last few weeks. And they're great kids. Do you find it easier to be a parent? No, I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren, so there are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. but we're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot, but it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or over punish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child and it was really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in other places, many, many other places around the country and around the world. And the fact that I learned several languages. And the fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/395_P/395_AUDIO.wav,1
396,29,1," Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Yes. Okay. Okay. Virginia. Really? When did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more diversity. How often do you go back to your hometown? Once a year maybe. How does it compare to LA? It's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there. Why did you live in LA? I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer, warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more going on. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? For me it was really easy because I wanted something, it was very different and I wanted something different. What are some things you really like about LA? I like all the things to do, like the museums, I like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? People don't appreciate what they have here, they just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back and bad drivers. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I would like to. I travel whenever I can, but usually can't afford to that much. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? Well, I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places. My wife and I like to see wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas. Cool. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. well we we've got we went to central California we'd like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally so we went to we went to Hearst Castle and see the seal the um the elephant seals and things like that Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess somewhere in between. What did you study at school? English and film. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was told I needed to go to college, and I hadn't quite decided what to do yet, so I just picked something I liked to do for the time being. Are you happy you did that? Well, I wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to. I might have done something different like physical therapy. Are you still working on that? No, I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before. Wow. What made you decide to do that? I needed to not starve and it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and it ended up being kind of fun. That's good. What's your dream job? Dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. Okay. How are you at controlling your number? Overall pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. it drives me crazy. Can you give me an example of that? You know, if I just sing something over and over and they're just clearly not listening, it makes me really upset. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't know. I spend a lot of time on them, but I don't know what the hardest one is, because if I decide to go with something, it's usually for a good reason. What's something you feel guilty about? Well, I guess I feel guilty about moving to California and that I left my family in Virginia. I mean, I know I shouldn't, but they always seem to miss me, and even though they don't like living there, you know, I'm the one that moved away, so it's like I abandoned them. How hard is that? Well, I mean, I don't miss Virginia, but I do miss them, so I guess a little hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my wife, with my in-laws, with my mom, dad, and sister. There's no problems. Everyone gets along well. How close are you to your family? Very close. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I mean anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It depends on how much exercise I have. I get a lot of exercise, it's pretty easy. If I don't, it's not. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Kind of like right now, just a little bit slowing out of it, but not really too different otherwise. How have you been feeling lately? Just kind of run down because my mother-in-law is dying, and we just spent like three days in the hospital, and we're going to go back after this, so not a lot of time to sleep. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Well, just slower and more tired and a little more out of it, that's all. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Usually just when I'm having a fun day either on my own or with my wife. That's pretty easy for me, just getting outside and hiking or exercising. It's not hard for me. How would your best friend describe you? I'm not sure. Maybe, um, maybe like eccentric, but in a good way, hopefully. No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be careful with your job to make sure you can keep from being injured and to, I don't know, just your normal kind of older kind of wisdom. Can you tell me about that? Not much to say really. Everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back into shape like I used to be. That's the biggest thing right now. Can you tell me more about that? Not much to say. It just hurt my back at work, and I just like to get past it because it's holding me back from doing a lot of things, that's all. Like what? Well, I used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more, and now I can only work out a little bit because it hurts too much. That sucks. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Probably like during the day going on a hike or two, a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night, you know, we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm most proud of moving here. I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and ended up doing something I regretted. but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My parents, my grandparents, my wife. Most people in my life have been. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/396_P/396_AUDIO.wav,0

Born and raised. Born and raised. What are some things you really like about L.A.? It's home, food, people, culture, traffic. What are some things you don't really like about L.A.? There's a lot of us. Too many of us, probably. Yeah. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot? I have in the past I haven't traveled lately what do you enjoy about traveling? the destination I don't enjoy the traveling anymore at all I did when I was young but no longer it's the destination point I'd love to hear about one of your trips okay in 92 I went to Spain and my grandma My father's mother was born in Spain. I went back to trace her roots. I spent a week in Madrid, a week in Barcelona, and a week in Mallorca. Had a great time. That's great. I enjoyed it. What was the most memorable experience? Oh. It was an everyday thing. People were friendly. Finding out some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting. What did you study at school? I studied poli-sci and sociology. How did you decide to do that? Well, at the time, it seemed like the easiest thing to do. Are you still working in that? No, no. What's your dream job? Well, I had my dream job for a while. I was doing sports research for Native American tribes. Awesome. I enjoyed it. But it's not as often as it was, mainly because of the sports bureaus that exist now that didn't exist when I started. When I do it, I still enjoy it. Do you feel more shy or outgoing? I'll be what suits me in any given situation. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I listen to music. Cool. Like what? I like oldies, jazz, soft music. How are you at controlling your temper? I've learned to do it well. It wasn't always that way, but I've learned to do it well. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? When I argue I assume you mean words. With my youngest daughter, that was about a year and a half ago. Can you tell me about that? It stemmed over an incident. I didn't like the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me. And when I told her she got extremely defensive. And rather than deal with it, she became angry with me. How did you feel in that moment? I was mad. Yeah. Tell me about your kids. Three girls, 38, 37, 31. Three granddaughters, 11, 14, 18. So I haven't won an argument in a long time, but I adore all six of them. Aw. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Well, now I don't really consider myself a parent. Since mine are grown, my baby's 31, and you never lose that. But I'm not parenting at this point in my life. I'm enjoying my grandchildren. When I was a parent, yeah, it's a difficult job. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? It's getting to their level and understanding what they understand and don't understand and not putting your stuff in front of theirs. What's the best thing about being a parent? The hugs. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Tell me about your relationship with your family. My dad was a hard guy, but I loved him. I never felt abused by him, but I mean, the one thing I remember, he said, when you're capable of kicking my ass, you can leave this house. That's kind of the basis of our relationship. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mother. My kids, my grandkids. Can you tell me about that? well I'm one of three sons so I really didn't have any experience with females other than with my mother in terms of being related and my grandma and when my first daughter was born it was like wow that was it I fell madly in love with her changed my life yeah that's the way it happened what's something you feel guilty about When my mother got sick, I wasn't there for her the way I should have been. And I don't feel good. You've done anything to avoid it? Oh, yeah. You can always fix what you do, yeah. I was just in a real bad situation. But that doesn't excuse the fact that I wasn't there the way I should have been. At least not in my mind. Tell me about a situation that you and she had handled differently. My second marriage probably. She wanted to have children. I already had my children with my first wife. And I had told her initially that I did not want to have children. I mean I had three. And I was good with that. And she indicated that she did not want to have children so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant and our relationship changed and I basically wouldn't relent and we ended up getting divorced I don't know that I would have had children with her but I I wasn't very flexible in the process what to be flexible I don't know sometimes I am sometimes I'm not I've been pulling my pulling my father out of life support I just kept going back to something he said to me when I was younger that he would come back and haunt me if I'd you know if I let him lay there and suffer. Took me a while to convince my other two brothers, but that's what we did. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Something I could erase from my memory. Being locked up for a while. I'd like to erase that from my memory. Can you tell me about that? It's just it's an everyday hell where there's very little humanity and You're gonna do some things that you're not proud of I've never slept. I've never slept a lot and I'm one of those people that if I wake up I have a hard time going back to sleep. So it's difficult. It's Unless I'm really tired then you know What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm pretty much the same. I don't change. How have you been feeling lately? So-so. I had a, uh, things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the little incident with my granddaughter, my youngest daughter. But I had a friend recently who was, uh, run over in a crosswalk and he's on, he's on life support. So I haven't been feeling too good about that. it's affected me. It wasn't like he was jaywalking or anything. He literally was walking in the crosswalk, and the guy never even hit the brake, so. And he's on life support at this point. Wow. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, not really. The consistent thing about me is I'm very inconsistent. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. But I've had moments where I felt I was depressed. Okay, I was talking when you were talking, so I didn't hear the question. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Yesterday, I had a conversation with my 14-year-old granddaughter. I'm happy. I have moments of happiness every day because I either speak to or text with my daughters and granddaughters every day, even if we're upset with one another. That's great. Is there anything you regret? Oh, I have a lot of regrets. Can you give me an example of that? I should have went to law school. That's kind of something I've begun to think about more in my lifetime. I was accepted. I just didn't, I had other things I thought I wanted to do. Like what? I played with wanting to be a kicker on a football team. Had some tryouts, things like that. But they didn't pan out. And as that didn't pan out, I sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer. So I just did other things. I don't think it would make that much difference I probably wouldn't listen to myself about myself I can be if I don't like you I can be very very difficult if I don't like you I'd very much like to change that it has in the past yeah Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. Well I was theory that you can make me feel bad about myself only if I let you. And I'm not real big on letting people do that to me. Although my first wife when she left me with the children she you know that it was my fault. And I wasn't sure that I believed that, but I knew I was an ass. And so I probably believed it, not in its totality, but in part. Yeah. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm very, I'm not judgmental. I will listen to anybody, whether I agree with you or disagree with you. I've taught myself to control anger that I have. And if I call you my friend or if I tell you I love you, I mean it. That's not something that I do casually. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Oh, okay. Well, I played 18 holes of golf with an old dear friend. We got caught up and we had four hours on the golf course, two hours of dinner, met a new wife. We had a good time. A lot of memories came back. What do you think of today's kids? I like my grandkids. I like the hell out of them. I don't know if all kids are like that. I think they rely too much on technology. But that's me, mainly because I don't. But if my grandkids are any sampling of it, I think they're pretty good. What are you most proud of in your life? Raising my girls. Basically by myself. With the help of my mother. I think that's the thing I'm most proud of. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Nice chatting with you. Goodbye. Bye. Alrighty. She looks like a girl who went to high school. Wow, you have a good memory. Now you can head back over to the other.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/397_P/397_AUDIO.wav,1
399,29,1," Okay. Okay. I'm going to move this behind your arm. Okay. All right, great. So now I'm going to give this to her again. When she's done talking, she'll let you know. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing here? Um, pretty good. That's good. Where are you from and where are you from? Uh, as far as my parents, Ethiopia. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about the West? Um, the beaches, the warm weather, um, the diverse environment. What are some things you don't really like about the West? Uh, traffic. What did you study at school? Well, I'm currently in school. I'm studying African Studies. How did you learn to do that? I've always been interested in African Studies, actually. I've always wanted to help people, and I figured that I could help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa and make an influence. That's great. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you eat to relax? I go to the beach and just sit there and play my guitar. How long do you do it completely? Pretty good. I don't really get angry or anything like that. I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing. When was the last time you argued with someone? I actually can't remember the last time I argued with someone. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Can you tell me about that? Well, I've, like, cheated on people, hurt their feelings intentionally, done things I shouldn't have done that I regret now. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had done differently. with me? Well, with my ex, I could have ended it better, so we could be on better terms now. I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things. I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out. Tell me about What was the hardest decision you've ever had to make? Okay, tell me about an event or a specific relationship you were experiencing. Tell me about that. Um, well, he had a tumor that he had to get removed. So it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there. Because he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that. But just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible. Yeah. And it sounds really hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Me and my family aren't very close. I mean, they've always been there for me and I appreciate it, but we've never had that close connection, especially since they're foreign, so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from, having been grown up out in America. So it's pretty different when it comes to the cultural boundaries that we kind of step each other's feet on. But aside from that, we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other. It does get kind of awkward, but it's okay. When do you think it's going to end? I think they are out of control. I think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age. I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing. And I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it. I feel like they're being applauded by the media. They're being applauded by celebrities that they follow. And there's not enough being done about it. and they're just getting lost. How easy is it to eat and sleep? Depends on the night. Some nights it's pretty hard. Some nights I fall asleep like a baby. What are you like in your sleep? Usually creative, actually. When I can't sleep, I'll just stay up and I'll write something or I'll read a book and ideas will pop up. Stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can't sleep. It's nothing really bad because I'm having bad thoughts or anything like that. Okay. How do you continue living? Lately, between a mix of good and bad, I have my happy moments where I'm energized and I'm alive. And then some days where I'm just sitting there, just mellow, thinking, not like my live self. Why? I don't know. It's just always been like that. Always have those ups and those downs. But they kind of balance each other out. No. No. The last time I felt really happy was... Today. Tell me more about that. Just from the moment I woke up, it was a beautiful sunny day. I went to see some friends, we had a good time. Went to school, had some good grades on some papers, wrote a good essay. I feel pretty accomplished and I feel like my day is just a good day. That's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would describe me as odd. Most people would describe me as odd. Why? I say a lot of odd things. I do odd things. I'm interested in things that most people aren't. What do you play? Um, just like old literature, um, revolutionary stuff, uh, stuff about changing the world, but through underground means. So, do you live a life of regret? Um, no, I don't live a life of regret. What advice would you give yourself to never let fear stop you from doing anything? How would you spend your real weekend? What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I don't wish I could change anything about myself. I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be. This one time, me and my best friend got into an argument, and she pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time, how I've hurt people, how I've hurt her, the ways I've done them that were brutal, and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all. Who is the person that's been a positive influence on you? My parents. Can you tell me about that? I mean, although we don't see eye to eye, they always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day. Although I never listen to them or I don't choose to listen to them, once it happens, I learn from it. And I'm like, oh, that's what my parents told me. So I learned to trust them more and I learned to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do know more than me. I'm sure you can tell them that you're not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not so much anymore. I travel around LA, try to find new sites to see, but as far as I don't travel outside. What do you enjoy most about traveling? Discovering new things. Discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities. I enjoy discovering new people, new cultures, new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself. When was the last time you were out there? Um, a few days ago, I just drove out to the middle of the desert, and I just sat there, and I just enjoyed all that the desert had to offer, and it was just enjoyable. Nice. How did you feel about it? Um, I felt free, away from all this, these cities and these buildings, and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time. It felt good. What are you most proud of in your life? Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. All right. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/399_P/399_AUDIO.wav,1
400,55,2," Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm fine. That's good. Where are you from and which name? Pacific Grove, California. What are some things you really like about LA? The wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything I could ever ask for. What are some things you don't really like about the way you work? I see. What did you study at school? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? What's your dream job? Open up a health practice of some sort. What means you decide to do that? Changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the benefit of health. That's great. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? When I have the opportunity. What do you enjoy about traveling? I must have heard about when you took the bus. Well, I used to go to Texas every year with my dad during the summer and I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert and shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that. It was. Let's see. Well, my dad and I are not really talking that much. And my mom passed away about two months ago. Thanks. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Why? Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best day of God. What do you do to relax? How are you at controlling your hunger? Sometimes I just don't get on something and I don't stop. Sometimes, but I've learned to control it to that extent now. Yesterday, I was arguing about what kind of water we should be drinking. Why? Tell me about a situation that you would see your family differently. every day is a growing process. I wish I would have handled everything differently every day, which is what makes me grow and I try to work toward how I would have wanted to handle things every day little by little. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Can't think of anyone right now. What's something you feel guilty about? Um, I'd say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices. Can you tell me about that? I'd rather not get into it. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you lately? The Raw Food Educators on YouTube and Raw Vegan Educators and the detox therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past two months. Tell me more about that. Well, they believe that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables, and this is true with many studies like T. Colin Campbell, the China study, and these sources of information that are very good and I think deserve respect based on real research. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Really easy. I've almost got it down to a science. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm tired. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling better than I have in a long time. Can you tell me about that? Uh, yeah, I think it's, uh, due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually, you know, loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over my short lifetime of, um, you know, toxic choices with food and drugs or whatever it would be. Mm-hmm. How do you understand the changes in the behavior of the baby? Yes, I'm less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my decisions and my wants versus what I need. That sort of thing. That's great. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes, to some extent. How long ago were you diagnosed? over five years ago lack of motivation basically my symptoms were paralleling that of depression loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear situations and as the main four or five no I believe I overcome the chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and I just sort of took another route which was alternative and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with the help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Yes. Can you tell me about that? I believe therapy is useful because without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that, it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resonate in the subconscious and tell you it has an outburst. Basically, therapy will help in overall health, mental health, I believe, for everybody. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last night, I made a really great vegan dinner with, you know, meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot. I almost converted them. That's great. Yeah. I would say you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know our body needs something other than that that's an example How hard is that? Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. formulas of crunching the numbers that it made it short, but he was unaware of the change I made to the formula. So the blame was on me that I may have took money and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uncertainty to the change of formula. No. No. No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 20 years ago, I was 2 years old. 10 years ago, I was 12 years old. I would tell myself to start eating raw fruits and vegetables every day. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? as calm and sad, maybe, smart, talented. Tell me about something that you really enjoyed. I really enjoyed going to the wholesale food market in downtown Los Angeles. Can you tell me about that? Awesome. eating and watching a really good TV show show I'm insightful I can I can adjust to people's I don't know I guess I'll skip that question for now. I'm most proud of, I'd say my overall situation with where I'm at right now. I could have never imagined that I'd be in such a fortunate situation. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye. I think she's done. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/400_P/400_AUDIO.wav,1
401,41,1," There I am. If you could just move your arms just a little bit, and you'll see a little stick figure pop up. There it is. Why does she look like someone I know? That's Kathleen. Sorry. No problem. I think that's probably good. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Alrighty. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes, I'm okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm good. I'm a little tired, but I'm good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Michigan. I'm from Michigan. When did you move to L.A.? A long time ago. Then I left. When did you go back to your hometown? Once, twice a year. How does it compare to L.A.? Cold. Very cold. Why did you move to L.A.? Because I wanted to pursue my acting career. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it wasn't a hard decision. It was just, it was the weather, it was the opportunity, it was the options. More options. What was it for you to get used to living in LA? The driving has been a pain in the butt. Not so easy. What are some things you really like about LA? Let's see. Besides the weather, I like that things are more convenient. I like some of the people here that are actually from home. But, yeah, I just, I like that it's a little laid back. That's about it. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. I don't like the gang violence in certain areas. And I don't like, what else don't I like? Maybe that's all I don't like. You know what I don't like? That it's so far away from home. I wish L.A. was kind of Midwest. I wish it wasn't so far from home. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a close relationship with my family. It's a small, immediate family is really small. and we're close my grandmother recently passed so it's um an adjustment right now but I'm close to my family I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Well, I can't see your shoes, but I do travel often. I do travel, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? Getting there. I like getting there. Once I'm at the, wherever I'm going, I like to actually do the tourist thing, get to know places and people. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Okay. Oh, I went to France a few years ago. Well, many years ago. And a little town called Carcassonne. and was very, it was actually really fun, but very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to see and what I actually saw. Like what I remember that I really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up, like there are no windows in the buildings, but there are these shutters that most places in the United States have inside of windows. They have them outside of the windows, and there's no glass, So you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned, like the buildings are abandoned. So pretty cool. I like that. Cool. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm borderline. Sometimes I'm shy. Sometimes I'm outgoing. It depends on who and what the situation is. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Music. I turn on music. I walk through the neighborhoods, you know. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. I'm not a hothead at all. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Hmm. Oh, it was an ex-roommate, and it was about my loyalty as a friend. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, pretty much she thought that because I wanted my rent, which she agreed to pay, that I was not being a good friend, that I should just let her live for free. That wasn't going to happen. The loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend I could have kicked her out I didn't she left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but you know she could have um could have it could have been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one I wish I had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and gotten my money up front that's what I wish I had done and I just I didn't my mind told me to go along with it no my mind told me to get the money up front but I didn't so The hardest decision? I think I have yet to make the hardest decision. But so far, like, maybe leaving home. Leaving home when I was years ago, when I was like 18. Yeah. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was abandoning my family. That's what I felt. But they encouraged me to go on and live my life. That's good. Tell me about Nivelle or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Something that I could erase from my memory. Probably a friend who I was dating. I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother was ill. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? um it's easy if I'm busy all day and I'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so it's not that easy actually it's not that easy I'd have to because I have to be exhausted I have to be exhausted to be exhausted no it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Up and down. I've been up and down. Like sometimes I've been excited and anxious, and on the other side I'm like, hmm, what am I doing? Are you triggered by something? Yeah, just an anxiousness to want to make some things happen, some goals. And getting certain kind of work and having a certain amount of income. and just taking care of myself, you know, the way I think I should take care of myself, just the physical stuff, eating right and everything. Yeah, I have. Sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment. And I'm conscious of that. I'm like, of all the things that's popping up in my head, why am I thinking about that? I let them happen and then I try to think about other things and phase it out. It pops back up, I phase it out. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. When the roommate moved out, I was really happy when she finally left. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I'm probably reading and maybe I'll go dancing. That would be ideal. I can go dancing, go salsa dancing. Yeah. Yeah. My ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. Really badly. I don't know if I have a time that someone has ever made me feel really badly. I don't feel bad about much. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? As courageous? Uh-huh. that would be it in a nutshell in general I regret not making some different decisions when I was younger as far as moving forward as far as career stuff and relationship things. I wish I had done some things earlier in my life that I'm doing now. Can you give me an example of that? Really going after some of my personal goals and deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long-term. Yeah, I wish I had done that earlier. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 20 years ago, I would have given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what I did and to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who I allow in my life. What are you most proud of in your life? Being a part of the family that I'm a part of. That's so good to hear. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. I didn't know if it went. Okay.

402,51,2," Okay, great. So I'm going to start up all the recordings now. Oops. Sorry. Can I mess it up? Yeah. It's kind of weird. Okay. Good? Okay. Okay. Okay. It's like a fake therapist. Does she talk back? Yes. Oh, my gosh. How? She's just using artificial intelligence. And I'll explain after this is over how it all works. So there's, like, nobody, like, making her do anything? Yeah, and you know, I'll... Or you can tell me later. Yeah, I'll tell you later. Okay. Like, why she was designed and everything, so you can try to back it up. Okay. Okay? All right, so what do I do? Just do what she says? She's going to start talking to you. Okay. And ask you a question. Just chat with her for a minute. And you said, if I don't want to answer, I can just say I don't want to answer. I don't want to talk about that. I don't want to talk about that. However you want to put it, she'll move on. And then you'll press this button to let me know that you're all done. She'll let you know when you're done. The wild. Okay, cool. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk show for people in the space and security environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm really learning about people, and I love learning about you. I'll ask you a few questions before we start. And please feel free to send me an email. The answers are here and there. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Atlanta, Georgia. Really? When did you go to LA? In 2006. How often do you go back to your hometown? Never. Why? Uh, I don't like it there. Okay. How does it compare to L.A.? Oh, it's completely boring and there's very little to do. L.A. is preferable, I think, to most places. I see. Why do you miss L.A.? because I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida. I moved there to be with him and he loves the water, but I love the mountains and I missed hiking and I didn't love Florida and he wasn't tied to it. So we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we could both be happy and also have more opportunities and business and all of the great things that it has to offer. That's good. How easy is it for you to get used to living in LA? Very. Very easy. What are some things you really like about LA? There's not much I don't like about LA. I love LA. I think it feels magical. So many creative, different people of all ages, shapes, sizes, colors, races. the mountains, the water, the city, all the things that there are to do, all of the different people there are to meet. I just, I love everything about LA. That's so good to hear. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer, but do you travel a lot? No. Why? I'd rather not talk about it. Okay. What did you study at school? I didn't go to college. What's your opinion on dogs? I'm still figuring that out. Can you tell me about that? I don't know. It may have something to do with animals. a dog that I really love and I never had a dog as an adult. I had cats and I think I'm a late bloomer so I'm working on that whole conversation. I don't, I really don't want a job. I want a purposeful way to create wealth, not just something to make money in the long run. Do you consider yourself a child or outgoing? It depends on the situation, but in general I consider myself more shy, although most people would consider me to be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Put on classical music. music classical music if i'm especially stressed and um play with my dog go for a walk i think i'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part um before i came here it was just about financial stress ah um There's probably a lot of examples. I think I'd rather move to another question. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Yeah, I'd rather not talk about that either. I'd rather not talk about that. Not very easy at all. A lot better recently, but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems, so it's challenging not to feel rested most of the time. How have you been feeling lately? In the past week, I've been feeling a lot better. Can you tell me about that? Yes, I, the weather has changed. Spring has sprung. It's a little warmer. I was having more trouble with my depression in the winter and I'm having trouble with tolerating cold. And so I wasn't doing a lot of the things that I normally do. And I also was sick with the flu, and in the past week I decided that I was feeling better enough that I needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day and walking my dog every day and not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more. so I was feeling, I've been feeling a lot better, like I've been making progress, and that in the past week things have taken a more positive turn. That's great. Have you ever been diagnosed with dyslexia? No. Have you been diagnosed with dyslexia? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? It's been quite some time. Officially, it's probably been... I don't know exactly, but let's see. Maybe more than 15 years ago. Um... I was feeling suicidal. No. Why did you stop? Because I found a better alternative. Tell me more about that. I've been in therapy off and on since I was 18, and I've tried a variety of methods. And then I started working with a neurolinguistic programmer, and that was really the first person that helped me make permanent changes, and I was able to get off my antidepressants as well. And even though I've struggled with some bouts of depression, it's never been anything extremely severe. And it was one of the best things that ever happened. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome. and I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease. And that was, he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated. So once I had my first conversation with him, I knew it was the right step for me. How did you feel when you were born? I was so happy. I felt like I, some, I felt that I found the answer that I'd been looking for, that I hadn't given up hope. And that I was like on cloud nine that I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally found the answer to the solution that I was looking for. I was like, it was the best thing I ever did in my life. It was the best decision I ever made. I felt extremely hopeful for the first time in a long time. I went to I went to a music store because I had been thinking about taking up an instrument I used to play the violin as a child and I've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt it's been extremely repressed and so I went to the music store to try out to see what it would feel like to to handle the instrument again and see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue. Awesome. It was awesome. Tell me how you spend your real weekend. Yeah, I'd rather not talk about that. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well... There's probably a lot, but... I'm always working on being more optimistic. it's been challenging it takes time but yeah I wish I could hear my own internal voice better Yeah, I have regrets. Sure, yeah. What advice would you give yourself? Thank you. value myself more so that I would make better relationship decisions. My fianc????????? is the most positive person in my life, my ultimate supporter. he's I think very unique not not at all selfish and probably a little too giving for his own good but always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone I know would give somebody the shirt off of his back is a genius in so many ways and I'm pretty lucky, I think. What are you most proud of in life? That I'm not a quitter. That despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time, I haven't given up on ",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/402_P/402_AUDIO.wav,1
403,17,1," Okay. Alright, so now I'm going to put the doorbell over here. When she's done, she'll let you know. Okay, step back. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions at the start. And please feel free to tell me. Your answers are very important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing really good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Granada Hills, California. It's the San Fernando Valley, part of Los Angeles. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. I like the diversity in people. I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one race or kind of food. I love the beaches, all the activities you could go do, theme parks, aquariums, stuff like that, museums. What are some things you don't really like about the lake? the smog, um, there's a lot of creepy guys. I've pretty much traveled around L.A. I've been cross-countrying back three times. Twice was when I was 17. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. And what did you do when you were six? When I was 17, I ran away with my boyfriend to upstate New York to Watertown. It was like a Navy Army kind of town. We had an apartment there. It snowed a lot. we sold antiques for a living. Getting passes, press passes for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through a friend and getting to meet rock stars and hang out at like the private parties. I'm very outgoing I love people I go to the gym and work out quite a bit I find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going I notice if I don't work out a couple days, I feel a little more tired than normal, and it just helps me feel good. I'm pretty good at it. I'm very calm. I've worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with, like, thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to, and you have to remain calm. And, you know, they're the customer, so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid because of the money they're spending. So I'm good at resolving, like, consumer conflicts and stuff on the job. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people. and I kind of started getting loud, like, just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean, you know. And I wonder, like, if you're talking to people like that, they might not like it and they could attack you or something, you know. You never know. It is L.A. Okay. That sucks. What's something you feel guilty about? I really don't feel guilty about anything, decisions I've made in my life. I think I've made really good decisions, and I always stick with my moral compass, what I'm doing. I grew up in church, so I haven't gone in years, but I still have those values and the rules, the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head. Tell me about a situation that you would see a little differently. I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him bully me out because it wasn't up to code. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. a few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming to LA and going back home I decided to move there and I had just started you know this business I was doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn't work out But it was tough deciding, like, should I leave L.A. and make this jump and try something new and experience something new or stay in what I was doing. I was, I had a degree in dental assisting. I did that for, like, a year. I didn't like it. And then I was studying communications, like, radio and television broadcasting and journalism. Are you still working on it? Um, somewhat. I'm doing event work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to, like, get a website going and then have, like, where I'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of, you know, writing for someone else. I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up I really liked Connie Chung She was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the 80s And I loved Barbara Walters I was a nerd, no my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom I never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them on phone we just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter. Oh, I go right to sleep. When I get tired, I just go to sleep. Pretty good, energetic. I've been motivated to go look for more event work, you know, event planning stuff and really grinding it more than I was. How hard is that? I mean, it's kind of hard because you've got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone I know dies I wouldn't say that I'm just super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even keel that I feel pretty good all the time I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or a group of people that I'm used to I could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt. I want to make more money. I remember in like second grade people used to make fun of me because I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's, one of the highest grades in the class so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that. Very talkative. She would just say that I talk to everyone and that I'm very friendly and if you need help, that I'll help someone, you know. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. Oh, recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and, like, took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool visiting her. I didn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and I like the area I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people. I think I pursue it, but I think maybe I could put a little more time a day into it. I don't really know anything like that I would want to erase or not happen. no I feel good about my choices I made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do the ball's rolling and I'm you know getting things done I'm not as big as I want to be but I feel like I'm on my way there um like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was um my friend we call mojo Can you tell me about that? Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball I'm rolling and he's one of the biggest people, you know, in my life telling me you're talented, you could do it. You know, he's just a really good like motivation for me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.

And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York City. Really? Why'd you move to LA? Well, originally I was born here, but I spent some time back east and moved back here and basically sort of raised here. So, been here a while, and I'm enjoying it. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great weather, amusement parks, a lot of scenery, a lot of people, a lot of energy and excitement. There's so many things to really like about LA. Wow. What are some things you don't really like about LA? See, a lot of congestion and pollution. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I try to, but no, I don't. What do you enjoy about traveling? It's nice to be in the open road with telling you time to think about my own life. Uh-huh. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Shy. Why? Sometimes I find it hard to express my own thoughts. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Well, you mentioned a fish tank, and I've spent some time in many waiting rooms where there's been fish tanks. tanks and so staring at fish tanks could be one of them but I also enjoy walking or lifting weights reading going to movies just to say a few things good moderate I said good in control argued about today okay last argument was today just before I got here and it was about having about how I said it's about taking them to a bus stop about how making an arrangement feel guilty about? Feel guilty about not taking better care of my pet. Can you tell me about that? Sure, I like birds, so one of my pets was a bird as of recently. And I I let my bird out into the wild and sort of wish I had planned for a better future for the bird, only because now I sort of wish the bird was closer to me. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I would say I get into arguments with people close to me, friends, and sometimes I don't handle them well. I am more reactive. So I wish, I'd like to see myself improve on that. Has that gotten you in trouble? No, at least not, you know, not in any sort of legal trouble, but I think it's, you know, it's kind of not the way that I would like to have handled it. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Wow. I guess the hardest decision was about to, of, How to proceed with moving forward on a job opportunity. Tell me about that. I had to decide whether if I would suffer more emotional pain by leaving my family and whether the financial gain and knowledge of that experience would outweigh the benefit. That sounds really hard. Are you happy with that? Yes. Yes, I am. That's good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, it's a small family, but I have a mother and a sister and a brother and two younger nieces. Older, they're grown adults. It's a good relationship and things could be better. Sometimes it's sort of difficult, pain, staking relationships at times. There's some days I'm, I need time for myself and I would rather give the time to other people rather than to take time for myself, which has been my experience. And so that has caused me a lot of emotional pain, a little bit of spiritual anxiety about my future if I continue to do that sort of thing. Tell me about Mubarak or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Wow, there's so many things. What about you? I don't know anything about you. I would say, well, there's a few, but of recent, things are going pretty good. I can't really say there's anything as of yet that I would really want to change or have anything to regret on that I can remember. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's been pretty good. And I'd say it's okay. I'm handling my sleep pretty well. What are you like when you don't sleep well? When I don't sleep well, sometimes I can be irritable. Sometimes it's okay. And I would say if there's also times where I'm unhappy. I try to get as much sleep as I need. Yes. I believe I was 19. And I'm glad I did it. Yes, sort of, but yes. Did you ever see combat? No. How did serving in the military change you? Well, I guess I suppose it made me a more confident person and more in tune with the country that I'm living in and people to be more noticeable, more watchful of where I live. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Hanging out with some friends on a really nice weekend on a boat or on a skiff, a really small boat and trying to fish. Nice. Nice. How did you feel in that moment? I felt free or alive, happy, uninhibited, strong, confident, mature. What did you do after the military? after the military. After the military, I took some time to evaluate my thoughts and my future. And I just sort of took the necessary steps to move ahead. How hard is that? It's sort of hard, it is. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It wasn't easy. A lot of family help and community. And so it took some adjusting, but it wasn't easy. I'm listening. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Uh, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. you know this week partially today happy happy sort of often not too happy but content happy happy I don't know I'm not usually too happy. I try to stay on the center line. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I deal weekend up early get out enjoy the day hook up with some friends and doing a a little bit of socializing and maybe get some form of view, some form of artistic expression. Like what? There's a, maybe like a museum or stare at some art or maybe something in the local community maybe street art and or perhaps something with music or something something of that nature What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? had the same ability for enact for for meeting more people I suppose best friends describe you I don't know nice friendly Trustworthy? Sociable? The same advice I gave myself today. Wow. I really enjoyed spending time with my girlfriend and her two children. And that was yesterday. And I'm glad I did that. It was a good time for everybody. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud I went into the military. and I'm glad I did that it's a good experience bye thank you Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/404_P/404_AUDIO.wav,1
405,50,2," Okay. Thanks. Thanks. Hi. Hello. Hi. Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. Not too bad. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Chicago, Southside. When did you move to LA? Back in 1978 when I was 18. Lately, not much, maybe once every two or three years. It's totally different, you know, horrible weather and yeah, it's just a whole different atmosphere. Let's see. My mother had moved to Africa. I graduated from high school, and I had a friend out here. So I just thought, well, let me try L.A. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in L.A.? Very easy, actually, yeah. I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane. Yeah. What are some things you really like about L.A.? Number one, the weather. Sun is very important to me. So I love the weather. I don't know, just kind of a more laid back atmosphere, variety of people. and now it's my my home base you know my friends that are family so it's kind of like my family is here now What are some things you normally make about your life? Hmm. I guess the smog, earthquakes, traffic, just basic things like that, really. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I don't currently but I did throughout my life I traveled quite a lot. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and just fun, the fun of it as well. um let's see well one trip I went to England Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip so that was a nice variety I guess you could say probably skiing in Val d'Isere, France. That was fun. I'm glad I got to do that. That's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm kind of shy by nature. I've tried to grow out of being shy, so I'm not fully shy, but I was always an extremely shy child. But now here in Culver City, this is my environment, and I guess you could say I'm not really shy in my hometown of Culver City. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? To relax, I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book, take a nap, watch TV, sometimes on the couch in the living room. Just you know, stay at home and kind of vegetate. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good, yeah. My temper is pretty level. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Tell me about your relationship with your family. family do you mean my family from childhood or my current family okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and um they can be kind of bitchy and and um but I have hope that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship um and then there's the husband which I I guess I could say soon to be ex-husband And hopefully soon we need to get a divorce, but we're still together due to financial reasons. And, yeah, so that's not good, the relationship with the husband. But since we have determined that we need to divorce, we don't expect anything out of each other, so we don't argue as much, so that's good. Tell me about a situation that you and she were in a little differently. Hmm. Wow. Wow. I guess our marriage, I wish I had noticed early on that, you know, it was like way off from what I thought it was. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let's see, oh my God. Hardest decision. I guess leaving my first husband, that was pretty hard. Can you tell me about that? Well, you know, we were married and I wasn't content, I guess you could say. And I kind of just gave up on our relationship. And now that I look back, I think it's because I wanted children and he would have been happy to never have any. and so since I didn't have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that's one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work and so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and um and I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was that was very hard because you know felt like I was hurting him which I was he survived he got over it now he's married with two kids but it was hard to leave him hmm something I wish I could erase from my memory. I have to think about that. I'm sure there's something. Oh, well, yeah, there's I guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory a recent, I'm not recent but an event in my recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends I've betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really needed a larger home and we just assumed, you know, that they would use my husband as their agent, both to sell their current home, current at the time, and to purchase a new home. And as it turned out, they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent. And yeah, that was devastating. I don't think I'd ever been betrayed like that. So I wish I could erase that. Because now, you know, this was back when the kids were really young. And my daughter at the time, my youngest daughter was, let's say, six, maybe. Maybe five. anyway her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and um they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something They were just so connected. They were just, you know, like two peas in a pod, even though their moms weren't talking to each other anymore. So now they're 13 and 14, and they're in middle school together, and they're still very connected. In fact, she, for the first time, spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl. and it's just a little awkward you know because now these girls are becoming really good friends better friends um and yet I still have this vivid um bad memory of what her her mom did to me. That was about, what, ten, about eight years ago. Anyway. I try to ignore it and put it out of my head, which I've been able to in recent years. But obviously it still comes up. anyway that that was that um not that easy i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up and can't get back to sleep or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up, you know, that typical thing. Well, the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom. And then, you know, it's not always that easy to get back to sleep. And then I wake up again to go to the bathroom. so I guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don't know I think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind in the day and I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day so it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to I guess well I'm kind of used to it now I just go on through the day probably looking looking tired and I'm kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I'm able to if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments, yeah, I might just, like I said earlier, just take a nap or something. Read my book, watch TV, whatever. Lately, how have I been feeling? Kind of down on myself, down on life. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have this pending need for separation slash divorce. I'm worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls. Now they're teenagers, you know, on the verge of adulthood. and so I worry that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and now it's too late um like I missed out on a lot of things and yeah I need a job I'm unemployed I don't know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff so I regret that extremely and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself because I need to divorce and move on with my life. So now I forget what the original question was, but that's the state, part of the state of my life. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you going to have sex? Well, the first time or recently? The first time, I guess, was, you know, when I was in my early 20s. I was just a little upset about, coincidentally, that was another breakup I had to make back then. And I was in my early 20s, and I needed to break up with my boyfriend. But again, it was very upsetting because I, you know, it was hard because he didn't want to break up. And I felt like I was hurting him. And I didn't understand this feeling. I was really upset. I didn't, that was my first time having depression, so I didn't really recognize it as depression. but I went somehow I had the knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I've had depression throughout the years Just, you know, little bits here and there for various reasons, such as, I guess it's usually a relationship, you know. Yeah, so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds, that was probably about two years ago. No. Why did you stop? Um, money. I don't have insurance. Otherwise, yeah, I'd be happy to go to therapy. Anything that might help. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Ooh. Boy. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know. I guess maybe when my children were born. That's... I guess happy. I don't know. I just, you know, I always wanted children, so it was nice to have them. That's, I don't know, that's all I can remember of that. I guess I don't remember the good times too well. I remember the bad times. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Hmm. Something I did that I really enjoyed. Hmm. Well, let's see. I, Friday night, I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends, and we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their houses. That was fun. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. What advice did you give yourself 10 or 15 years ago? Stay in college, get my degree, get therapy, try to become happy. yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and oh and mainly i think the mean you know what it all boils down to no matter what you're depressed about it seems like as as the saying goes and the songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money and having none that in itself is very depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life, having no money is, you know, it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it. So with that in mind, I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it. don't quit to go traveling, you know, just stick with a job, stick with a company, build up your seniority, keep your benefits, and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field. Yeah, that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself. Not much. I guess just my daughters, you know. They're beautiful daughters. And I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children. Some people aren't even able to do that, you know. they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but um I'm I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of is having my two daughters I'm a very loyal friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating yeah very loyal very happy what was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don't know where that came from. I'm very, I meant to say friendly and caring. And yeah, I care about people. And I'm interested in people. And I care about animals as well. Actually, that's another thing I'm proud of, proud of being a vegetarian. Yeah, so my daughters and being vegetarian. and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings, not only humans but animals too. And, you know, I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them. So what was the question? Do you remember the question? Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Bye. Bye. Bye. I did need the tissue one time, so that's good. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/405_P/405_AUDIO.wav,0
406,21,1," Okay. Hi, I'm Ellen. I'm a student at the University of Michigan. I just finished a class today and I'm very, very nervous. I'm not a very good speaker, but I'm really learning a lot of things, and I'm glad to be here. I like to be a good speaker. I'm going to be speaking for a few minutes, but I'm going to be speaking for a few minutes. Are you ready for this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. I'm originally from Southern California. I like the downtown theater district. I like the beaches. I like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day. What are some things you don't like about LA? I'm sure you can tell them and see. I'm not making a word of story. Do you travel a lot? Why? been able to travel. I just haven't traveled. I like going to new places and seeing things I haven't seen before and if I can like visiting places like Landmark. Well the last one I did with San Francisco that wasn't so far but I got to stay in downtown San Francisco and I got to go shopping and I got to get on the streetcar so that was cool well I still study I'm studying psychology. Well, I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly. So I went to junior college. And then when it got close to graduate, I knew I wanted to transfer. So I'd taken a couple of psychology courses and I decided I liked it so I just decided to make that my major and I thought it didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math. Well now that I'm almost done I don't know if I'm going to continue in that area. I understand. What's your dream job? Okay. Do you think of yourself as shy or outgoing? Sometimes when I'm doing things, I can only think of screen savers. Hey, I know it's not for watching, but it's for best-of-guys. What do you do when you're on the house? What's what? movie with subtitles so I think I'm pretty good hmm you know I know they're not really long arguments I don't know if they're real arguments I know I argued with my boyfriend because he hung up my face I don't know why and it got solved pretty quickly so I don't know if it was really that important wait I walked out without saying oh okay I can't think of one right now Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. I think the hardest decision I probably had to make was moving from, well, back to California, from Oregon. Can you tell me about that? What made you decide to do it? What do you mean? What's something you feel very good about? guilty about many things. Well, I don't talk to them that much. My dad and my stepmom live in Oregon so I probably talk to them on the phone at least once or twice a month. And then when they come out here, I want to say at least once a year. Sometimes it can be twice, you know, occasionally more, but not too often. and I see them. That's about it, but I'm pretty much the only one out here. My brother is also up there as well. Yeah. What's some of the positive influences you've had? Well, I've had lots of positive influences, I think. Just regular people I come across, you know, maybe someone I've worked with, maybe. Oh, actually, my uncle, he's a really good positive influence. He knows quite a bit, has lots of good advice. What advice? About life. Okay. Tell me about your life. Is there anything that you would consider doing? Hmm. Hmm. you know I don't really think I've had anything that bad happen to me where I just don't uh what bothers me so much I have to not think about it well I can't say pretty easy because I work a hot schedule and then I go to school but um yeah if I want to go to sleep I sleep really well though as long as I have enough you know hours really really happy and good nope No Are you always happy? Are you happy about that? Awesome! Oh, I haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat. But the last activity that I had a lot of fun doing was ice skating in December in downtown LA. No, I don't really have too many regrets. I mean, whatever happens, happens. And, you know, it was meant to play out that way. Hmm. Well, um... I guess I would say don't worry too much about the small things. even though they seem really big, they really are insignificant and you won't think about it six months from now. I think my best qualities are I'm a happy person, I'm a fun person, I'm pretty easy to get along with I think most people like me and I'm just a cool person. What are some things you wish you could change in your life? Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. I don't think I want to talk about that. Okay. What is the most powerful thing you have? Hmm. I don't know. I guess just taking care of myself, supporting myself, not having to go back home. I guess that's about the best accomplishment there is. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Okay. Was that you on the other end? No. I'll explain a little bit more about how it works after you've done a quick post-it. All right. So you can move back over to that computer. We'll have you do a quick post-it.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/406_P/406_AUDIO.wav,0
407,34,1," Oh, so she's like going to be a counselor, kind of. All right. So now she's going to share with you for a bit, and then this time when she's done, she will let you know. And then I just press that? Right here? Yep, you press that. Cool. Cool. And then we just have that again and then we're done? Cool. Alright, cool. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and stay in a healthy environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are full of confidence. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? I only have school on the weekdays, so I actually slept probably like 85% of the day, so I actually feel kind of good, but I'm actually kind of tired as well. I have other stuff going on, but other than that, I'm good today. Okay. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from Bakersfield, California. Really? Really. When did you move to L.A.? I moved to LA when I was an infant and I left here when I was around three or four and I've been moved I've moved back here in 07 and I've been living here um ever since um wow since I've been here since 07 I've only been back maybe maybe like a couple times well i went there for like a summer like in oh eight i think i was there for like almost a whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here unfortunately uh uh uh it compares to la um it doesn't really compare to la i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield and i lived here and then anyways i don't know if I did I forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um LA has all this stuff to do has um oceans and it's by all kinds of um located by a lot of cool places like Vegas and San Diego and what have you not um but yeah other than that I miss my friends and stuff but I don't miss like the actual city I just miss some of the people that I grew up with. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. Actually, I've only been out of California like six times. So I would like to travel once I have enough money to do so. Okay. What did you study at school? Well, originally I wanted to be a filmmaker. which I still want to be a filmmaker. And I took communications and did general ed stuff too and took video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to filmmaking. And I have learned a lot of stuff, and I still have that knowledge. However, I haven't really used it since I've been back here in L.A. I did all that stuff in Northern California and Sacramento. And then I switched over to business, to business, which I took some classes in that, but now I'm actually studying to be an optician, and I'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician, so, but I do want to be a, I actually still want to be a filmmaker, and that's still one of my plans, and I still actually, I got into playing poker a few years ago, and I really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or a full-time poker player, however, both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere to be optician oh um uh i guess i would just try to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you don't do like your GE and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like um a major or whatever you're going to do so it just trains you specifically to be optician and jump in the field I um took it just because I actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe I could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be optician so I'm now trying to be an optician and it's interesting So it's fun. It's really hard, but it's interesting and it has rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses, whatever they feel more comfortable with. That's great. Cool. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm definitely outgoing however I can be shy sometimes like I'm kind of shy right now because I'm talking to you and you're in the computer and you're a cartoon or I animated it or whatever so cool but no usually 98% I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got I need to relax um I actually which is actually kind of funny and I think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too um I don't really I've never really talked to any professional poker players but as far as like um I actually playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like I am really relaxed I really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kind of like a therapy thing for me because I don't like I guess you could say it's a kind of drug because I don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past I just like focus on poker so it's actually kind of relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so I guess it's kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but uh yeah so no poker I play like to play basketball I like to watch movies. I like to go to the beach actually. One of the things I like to do is go to the beach because it makes me feel good. I usually only go to the beach when it's hot, not during the cold season. So it's coming up soon. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm going to be busy, but I'll try to go to the beach as much as I can. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? um I'm really good at controlling my temper actually I've only been in like I'm 30 years old I've been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so I've never started a real fight in my whole life like I started fights when I was a little kid but talking about like real stuff like once you get past it like 13 14 um but yeah no I'm good like every now and then like there's been a couple times maybe in the past where like I wasn't able to control it but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occurred and never would but for um majority of the time yeah I don't have like people do stupid things all the time and I just like let it go especially like um on the freeway and stuff but uh oh well I mean I agreed about with my ex-girlfriend a lot but um it was just about really petty things I guess that maybe we just I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped heads too much so obviously she's my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend things I guess my filming there's a lot of stuff I gotta handle differently but maybe like when I was doing really good when I was younger and I was working for Production assistant for filmmakers around where I lived in Sacramento. So I was doing everything that I wanted to do as far as my dreams were concerned. And I had a lot, all my stuff together. I had my own car, my own apartment. And then I got involved with like the wrong group of people, I guess. And kind of tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything. Like car, job, apartment. So I just wish that maybe I never got involved with those kind of people. that kind of girl ever because I would probably, my life would probably be a lot different now. However, I believe that anything happens for a reason. And obviously, I think you should also, like, stuff that happens, good or bad, learn from your mistakes. So, when it happens again, you could not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad, I guess. So, you know, Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision. I guess... I guess... Hardest decision... The hardest decision I have ever had to make would be... I guess you could say I don't really know it's gonna say that maybe like my ex-girlfriend like I could have like stayed with her and I really like still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but I guess the biggest decision that I had to make was like I know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and I know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that I don't think would end up working out anyways so I guess the decision my hard decision would be to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and uh be not with her so I guess that was a hard really hard decision because um I could easily have done it and I guess maybe I would have been happier in that way but stressed out and um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her I guess deal with each other our relationship so it was really hard, still is, so I guess that's it. Not choosing to be with someone that I loved and loved me or whatever. Cool. Tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. What was that? I beg your pardon? Tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Nevada? I don't understand the first part of that question. Oh, an event. Oh, an event. Okay. That I could erase. Event that I could erase from my memory. My ex-girlfriend. I wish I had never met her. My first girlfriend and my last girlfriend. and I wish I never met them because we were together in love for a few years, and then we broke up, and it was really hard. So I guess both of them. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, it's extremely easy. I could fall asleep anywhere. Actually, the other day I broke a record. I almost fell asleep standing up, which would have been weird because I guess I would have fallen down or something. I don't know. I just caught myself. I mean I was really tired but I do a lot of stuff so it's hard for I don't really get that much sleep as much as I would like but I get sleep when I'm dead or whatever as they say no no How have you been feeling lately? How do you cope with that? I've obviously even devoted people to God, regardless of what they are. They sometimes lose faith, so I do lose faith sometimes, but it doesn't really last for that long, and I know that there is a God, and I know that I'll be okay and that everything will be okay, but it's hard. Deal with them. I just keep going. I go to school and work, and I just have to keep going. I can't give up, so I just try to stay busy. Staying busy helps, kind of, and sleeping a lot helps, but I don't get to sleep a lot. So I don't know. Playing poker, playing basketball helps me deal with it. Hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes. How was that the last time you felt really happy? I felt really happy on Friday because I went to San Diego for the first time. and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but we're like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so i would much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun and it was cool um i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked i was had fun and i was happy about going to san diego for the first time and i had a good time that's great what advice did you give yourself 10 years ago um a lot of things but i guess i would say like be nicer to like um family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would have been different to um acted different to not that i was like horrible but i could have been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh i would have never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did like high school and different part times of out of high school i would have just really focused on um schooling and stuff and then did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would have just told myself more basically to be more have more direction be more focused i guess uh stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people I guess not that I'm the healthiest but um yeah I just would have done a lot of stuff different but I don't know if I said earlier but I believe everything happens for a reason um so I guess everything's happening now for a reason so I'm just gonna keep going uh I guess the few that I do have are the few that I used to have because I have best friends now a couple I guess one new one and I've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went our own ways but I guess they would all probably describe me more as like um energetic uh funny crazy uh loud uh silly uh smart and uh I just I guess in uh in general just like entertaining to be around. I haven't always been the bestest best friend, but I try my hardest. So that's it. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Change myself? I wish I was I wish I was like 15 pounds lighter. Um, I wish I didn't need, uh, how do I put this? I feel like, um, I feel like I'm a, I feel like I, I need to be like in a relationship with a girl, but I feel like I wish I didn't have to be like, feel like that I needed to have a girl all the time. And so I could, that can help me like focus more and I wish that like I didn't need sexual um I wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as I do because I feel like if I didn't concentrate or have to do like get be with girls or in a relationship to like well I don't know how to say it but I'm just saying like I there's like guy friends that I know that don't need sex as much as I do and I feel like I need it more than I feel like sometimes that I wish I didn't need as much so maybe I guess I'm addicted to it a little bit where like I could focus on more things other than just I mean I don't just focus on sex but I just feel like if I focus on if I didn't want it need it or think I need it as much that I could get more stuff done in my life but yeah so I'm trying I'm working on that What are you most proud of in your life? What am I most proud of? I'm most proud of... I'm most... I guess I'm most proud of working for a television station back in Sacramento and working on a lot of film sets because like I I was 16 and I decided I wanted to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year and a half later basically I got I started making steps to become a filmmaker and then I ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really um really um good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was that lives in Sacramento know they did a lot of things so i'm proud that i had a dream and i went for it and i actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so um yeah i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishments which was like over 10 years ago but i hopefully something like that could happen again soon or you know that's great okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts perfect goodbye Cool.

I have traveled some. What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to go to the Olympics. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Probably traveling through rail along Europe and getting to know cities in that way. Awesome! Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Totally outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I do meditation. How did you decide to do that? It's usually a practice that becomes very natural so my body is able to sense when I'm not feeling at ease and I naturally breathe and start my meditation process. How hard is that? It could be hard if you don't practice that every day or if you're not able to quiet your mind. However, if you meditate for a long time, it becomes a practice like going to the gym or drinking daily water. You can naturally learn to meditate. How are you at controlling your hunger? I think I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? I typically do not argue. I don't remember any instance of arguing with anyone recently. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had done differently. Maybe being on the freeway and taking the wrong exit. it i would have probably paid attention to my probably gps or not being overconfident tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make hardest decision i ever had to make i guess moving back from europe to la coming back home i miss my friends What made you decide to do that? Tell me about your relationship with your family. That's so good to hear. Who is someone that has been a positive influence in your life? My teachers, my parents, and definitely my mentors. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Well, I don't think I have anything that bad that I want to erase from my memory. I can't think of any, sorry. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? the bed. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling good. Have you ever studied music as a beginner or a top student? No. Okay. Tell me about the last time you I felt really happy about two months ago. I went to Prince's birthday. She celebrated in that casino by a city away from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and I was playing with a 25 cents with quarters and I won like $75 in the machine, so that was very cool. Nice. How are your best friends driving you? outgoing, always planning something exciting to do, very outspoken. Is there anything you regret? Not that I know of, no. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 15 years ago? Always do what you want to do. Life is short and always keep on learning. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I want to lose two more pounds. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. I've been very, very blessed. I've never really felt anyone make me feel bad. I usually interact well with everyone I meet and I am very blessed to have everyone be nice to me. me. That's great. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm a great listener. I spend quality time with my friends and family. Not quantity necessarily, but quality time. And I'm very supportive and I love to pretty much listen, listen and listen. Sometimes that's all people need. What did you study at school? I went to school, I have two degrees, a business management degree and also I have a language degree. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I learned languages when I was very little, had the opportunity to travel and it was easier for me to keep on learning languages. And the business part, I enjoy interacting with people, creating new ideas, innovating. So I believe that's where my interest in business came from. Are you still working in that? Yes, I am. What's your dream job? My dream job, one that wouldn't have probably challenges every day. one that I could, I don't know, just come to the office and everybody and everything would be perfect, but it's not real. So I think one of the main things about having a job is enjoying those challenges. What are you most proud of in life? I'm very proud of myself, my accomplishments, and I'm also very proud of my family and my and how they have achieved and overcome their obstacles. Can you give me an example of that? Sure. I have a friend of mine who is now at New York State University. She had quite some challenges trying to get there and funding her education, and now she is not only in the school, but she has acquired some funding for her education and through a lot of writing letters and petitions and things she did in order to conquer her dream to be in school. So very proud of her. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Bye.

409,45,2," you're saying right this is okay just want to say one thing real quick here too late I just want to say okay I miss my recall isn't that good I don't know the time I deal with here last time because when I went back there I didn't ask me questions like recall questions from this so I should try to be aware of like how I'm answering or what she thinks about her? No, I would just, you know, just be comfortable. Just have a conversation with her. Okay. There won't be, it's not like memory questions where you're going to have to remember. Okay. All right. She'll just ask you kind of how you felt about the experience and what you thought about it. Oh, I see. I wouldn't worry too much about that. Okay, I got you. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to give you the doorbell, and then you're going to press this button when she's all done. She'll let you know when she's done, okay? Well, what she's saying is no. She'll say bye. Okay, I got you then. All right, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. The answers are full of confidence. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Doing okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from LA. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather, I like the sports teams, I like the entertainment. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's pretty much the same year round as far as, well actually the weather could be good and could be bad, you don't get to get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag. and uh... i guess i mean i'm kinda used to it by now so because i think for other areas i was wrong my life and too much traveling so uh... a little bit about kind of a readiness to it but uh... overall it's okay uh... like to computer programming operations that's going back to the seventies knowledge change a lot as you can tell last forty odd years That was my major, yeah. What made you decide to do that? I don't know. It was kind of inquisitive. You get to use your mind. It was like brand new, something very novel back in the old days, back in the 70s. Now everybody's into computers, but back then it was sort of like something very unique. You didn't see too many computers around back then. I didn't come programming, so I was kind of into the logicalness of it, you know, putting together, you know, solving a particular problem, you know, come up with step-by-step solutions on it. I guess I'll sort of, back then I was kind of more into the analytical, I can't say that word now, the analyticalness of the problem. Are you still working on that? No, I kind of phased out. I still use computers, but I haven't gotten, I haven't been in programming for a long time. Why? Well, I kind of got into another area, kind of diverged into another area of my life. This is going back to the late 70s. I kind of took another turn, and then by the time I kind of got back into it, I kind of got into another field, so I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to. What's your dream job? Wow, that's a good question. I never thought about that. Well, actually, ironically, actually, it's something pretty simple. At this point in time, this is what maybe I'm kind of like a little bit depressed, and then at this point I kind of just want to kind of just do a nice relaxing job. But I do want somewhat of a challenge, but I don't want to have to like do too much thinking. It's almost like the opposite of what I was back in the old days, you know. I just want a nice, comfortable, relaxing job that I can feel fulfillment on, but I don't want too tense of a situation. I'm kind of at the point in my life where I just want a nice, relaxing job. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Oh, I would say, well, for the most part shy, but sometimes once I get going, I could be outgoing. But, generally speaking, I'm shy to begin with, and then at times I can kind of loosen up and be more outgoing. And sometimes I can take it to the extreme where I'm talking too much. Once the floodgates open up, they kind of open up too much, so I have to back off. But overall, I would say I'm kind of shy is a general demeanor. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Oh, really? I know it's not Hawaii. It's the best I've got. Yeah. What do you do to relax? Oh, well, I listen to music. Like I'll watch TV. I'll just ??????????????what do I do to relax? Well, I just try to avoid stressful situations, so I kind of stay relaxed. I also talk to my friends too. I'll be around an area, kind of a comfort area where I feel safe. I can just dialogue with people. So it kind of gets me out of my ??????????????thinking about my own problems I'm having, I kind of just focus on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances.tty good. I don't really have a temper problem. It takes a lot to get me to explode. I think in my younger days, I think I was a little bit more, had a slight bit of temper. I never had a really bad temper, but temper's not really an issue I have. I tend to be pretty mellow, easygoing. That's good. Yeah. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Wow, that's a good question. I'm not sure, to be honest. I didn't think about that for a long time. To be honest, I can't come up with an answer on that. It's not really part of my repertoire. Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. well um well the only thing I think kind of going way back I made some bad investments back about 10 years ago I was more um I'm trying to think of the right word I'm looking for more trusting of people like people who I thought were expert in their field and um I inherited some money and I was a little bit careless with it and I just kind of had a vibe you know that nothing would go wrong, kind of a little bit of naivety. And unfortunately, I made some bad financial decisions. It kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life, unfortunately, because of the medical conditions I have. It's hard for me to rebound and, you know, make it all up. So I would say mainly financial investment decisions that I really regret. I see. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Wow. Hmm. That's a tough one. I can't think of anything off the top of my head. Okay. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I don't really have too much family left. The only one I have is my, it's just me and my uncle. We communicate on a regular basis. He lives in Clearwater, Florida. So we're okay, but he's in his 80s, and obviously I'm in my 50s. So we have kind of small talk, and he's kind of concerned about my well-being, but it's kind of somewhat on a shallow level. We don't get really deep, and he's got his own problems, so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation. And other than him, there's not really anybody else I have. So that probably makes me a little bit depressed because I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on or really confide in. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It is challenging. I don't know why, but I do have a medical condition, so I think that might be part of the problem. And I have a little bit of BPH, so occasionally I'll get up and have to go to the restroom. And to answer your question, to make a long story short, It is challenging to get a good night's sleep. I usually wake up feeling a little bit tired or achy, but it is difficult. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been feeling okay. I mean, I've been kind of feeling mellow, actually. I'm trying to address issues that I haven't taken responsibility for, But I feel a bit of calmness as of late. No. Well, I did say yes when I filled out the questionnaire, and I'm not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it. I did take a, I think it's called the MMPH, the Minnesota Multifaceted Personality, something of whether, this is going back about six months ago. They were asking me questions about my memory, but then they also got into questions about my well-being psychologically too. And I think some of the answers said that they advised that I see a psychologist or a psychiatrist. I didn't follow up on that because of philosophical differences. But I think I might have a mild case of depression. Why? Well, like I said, I'm just kind of going along in life. I'm doing okay, but, you know, kind of life's passed me by, so I haven't really fulfilled my goals. You know, I'm kind of like alone. I'd like to have a girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend, so that's kind of somebody who I feel I can get close to. And I'm not really, I'm kind of in a transitional period in my life right now, so there's a little bit of uncertainty. I have some, you know, kind of financial uncertainties. So, you know, overall, I'm not doing as good as I'd like to. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Wow. That's a good one. Really happy. Let me think about that a minute. Well, actually, it wasn't that long ago, actually. I went to, okay, I know that one, actually. I can come up with an answer. I helped out a lady. She was at a trade show. It was Anaheim. It was a natural products expo, so it was pretty nice. We had some nice meals afterwards. There was a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples. It was in Anaheim, so I kind of got a chance to get away from L.A. And, you know, met some interesting people. They were very outgoing. They were willing to, like, have me experience their product or service. And I was around people that I worked with who I got to socialize with. So I think I was pretty happy back then. And that was about a month ago. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. Yeah, it was. How would your best friend describe you? Best friend. I don't know if I really have a best friend. But I would say, I don't know. Technically, I really don't have a best friend. So it's really hard for me to answer that. So I can't really come up with an answer, to be honest. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I like to be conscientious. I do have flaws in the area, but I think overall I'm conscientious. I try to be honest for the most part on the major issues. I might say what a light wise or I'm not perfect on that, but when it comes to the serious stuff, I tend to be pretty honest. I'm a hard worker. I've got good work ethic. I tend to be pretty calm for the most part. Mm-hmm. Is there anything you regret? What do I regret? Well, can you elaborate on that? Whatever comes to mind. Well, I just, well, just overall, I regret not being a little more assertive in my earlier life and kind of put myself in this position. It kind of goes back to my financial decisions. That's sort of like my albatross in my life. I made some bad decisions, and unfortunately, I have to kind of pay the price for now. So I'm sort of like living sort of a pauper existence right now, which is kind of depressing. So I would say that's probably what I regret most of all. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, I would say to really analyze, kind of go with what you really feel. I think I was going with other people's opinion, other people's advice. I was kind of going away from my basic beingness, you know, like the way I really felt. Like, for example, I would do aggressive investing, which if it turned out good, it would have been like sort of like winning the lot. I would have been well off for the rest of my life. But unfortunately, it went the opposite way. Too many eggs in that basket. So I kind of regretted going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me. Because by nature, I'm a conservative person, so I should really do more conservative investments. In other areas of my life, I tend to be more conservative, but I kind of made some aggressive financial decisions. So that pretty much kind of always goes back to that area as far as what I regret. Right. Yeah. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Wow. That's interesting. I've been doing a lot of work on weekends Well, I do like to be profitable I like to do something where I can actually make money That's sort of my bread and butter time Because I do trade shows But if I'm not doing that Then I like to maybe watch some I like to go to entertainment Maybe go to a ball game Go to a movie Go out with some friends So I'll just kind of kick back But my main primary focus would be on You know, earning money on the weekends. What are you most proud of in your life? Huh. That's interesting. Most proud of. I would say that I lived, by and large, I lived a wholesome life, I would say. I never got myself into any kind of really bad vice. I lived a pretty wholesome life I'd say that would probably I was really proud but as far as I stayed the course as far as not going down any real deep alley so to speak okay my pleasure bye now That's pretty interesting. It's improved your technology, huh? It's a lot more like you're talking to a live person. Oh, good. I think the last time I did it was kind of a little bit more like anime. You can tell it's more like a video game. This looks more like a real person communicating. Did you do one with her before you did it? No, not her. I don't think I did it with her. other guys and I can't remember what it was but it was a little bit more, I can't remember all the details but this seemed more comfortable, more natural.

Where are you from originally? California. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? The beach. I love the water. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The gang violence. violence. Can you tell me about that? I lost a lot of friends growing up in through elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, thank you. It's pretty tough out there. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I haven't been to any place out of California yet, so not really. Okay. What's your study at school? I'm an optician. I'm a certified optician and I also have my associate's degree. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Um, actually, I went in, I didn't really know what I wanted to do when I first applied. I just knew I wanted to change my life and do something successful before I settled down and now have my daughter and everything. Actually, my guidance counselor kind of helped me, and I always thought, like, they were so cool because they're white, long, lab coats. What's your dream job? To be an optometrist. Why? Because I'm already an optician, and that's like the first step. And why, it was a good question. It's because then I would be able to have my own business, and I'll have something successful to leave to my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want for anything it would be like a family business but to help the community as well and something I can leave for my daughter. Tell me about your kids. My daughter she's five years old she'll be starting elementary school next week and today is her birthday. Five years ago I had her. She is very smart. I taught her home, I homeschooled her for five years and she's adorable. She's my heart. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No, this is like the hardest job ever. It's very hard. Providing, providing, making sure that you wash their clothes. because I mean it's hard enough to be a parent but I'm a young parent and I'm a little more mature than her father so it's um it's it's the providing part I would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so complicated and let alone um it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um me even being here today i probably would have still been in bed but today's my daughter's party and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i can make you know to make sure that she has a good day so it's all about um going that extra mile the only thing that you can do to provide for them but it's a very hard job yeah what's the best thing What was the most important thing about being a parent? That moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you. My daughter, her favorite thing to tell me is I'm her heart. How when they call your name, it's a sense of reality to be called mom or to be called dad. It just like, it infatuates you, it also lets you know that this is reality, this is my life, this is what I'm living right now. It's a very good feeling, that's the best part of being a parent. That's so good to hear. Thank you. What are some ways that you're different as a parent from your parents? A lot of different things. I'm actually taking care of my daughter. I'm here with her. I was raised by my grandparents. So, I mean, I didn't really, I didn't get to know my mom until I was 16. And my father, I mean, I couldn't point him out on the street, on the sidewalk, so I don't know who he is. So I feel that I'm very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting, I don't give up. Yeah. Yeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life. I can say my sister, she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field. She's an LVN, and she's one of my older sisters. I can say me believing in God being in my life God being in my life has also kept me strong and to know that I don't have to take on this world by myself because God is there for me and I don't know I don't really look up to a lot of different people because people like, so that's the most, like, I think that's been positive for me. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm outgoing. I used to be shy coming up as a kid, and I don't know. I don't know what happened to me. One day it just broke out of my shell and I've been very accurate of showing my personality off. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? I actually like for the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach. And I like to just sit there and just zone everybody else out back there and rub my toes in the sand. And that is so relaxing. How are you at controlling your hunger? Excuse me, sorry about that. I learned that to, because it's a form of, it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or is it someone else's. And I feel that my temper, me controlling my temper, is showing that I'm in charge of my life. So I don't even let stuff get to me. I don't even really remember the last time that I had to control my temper because that's how much I try to block out the negativity. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Probably my husband, my daughter's father. Probably over like, you know, the dishes or like the small things, but not a physical altercation like with another human being. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Wow. Um, being honest, I kind of feel guilty about how things, like, basically how things ended before my mom passed. I wish that I could have helped her a little more, even though people told me not to feel bad, um, because she wasn't really there for me growing up. But I kind of feel guilty, like, you know, not being there as much as I could have been for her before she passed away. So I think that's something that I still feel guilty for. Okay. Tell me about Nivelle or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. going through my mom passing away. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like, I felt like, basically that it was, I felt kind of robbed in a sense. like I felt everyone else had parents and I grew up with my grandparents and then for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad for me to get 18 years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like um I don't know it was nerve-wracking because I felt robbed you know I was like, I didn't have her all these years, and then now that I'm older, and I don't even have her now. Yeah, I'm sorry. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Signing the paper of having a C-section when it was time for me to have my daughter. I was so nervous, so scared. Really didn't know what to do, how to take it. I mean, like, that was so scary. Almost the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world. Yes. I didn't sleep last night. That's why I'm yarning. But I kind of tend to try to do everything. And I have to get back to that stage where I have to think about myself as well. And give myself time. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, a little like this, but actually I'm a little nicer today. Um, just groggy. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Lately I've been feeling very confident about being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent. That's great. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yeah, I actually really don't care what other people think anymore. I used to let that bother me. I don't no more. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Today, I'm so happy that I brought my daughter to this world today on her birthday. Uh-huh. What would you say are some of your best qualities? getting to know people. Not at the moment. So watch who I associate with. change about yourself? My weight. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really What do you think about yourself? Um... Also my grandma. Can you tell me about that? Um... Um... I really do not. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? My daughter. It's my pride and joy. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Wow, thank you. Goodbye. Bye. This is cool, I need to take her home. You can take the headset off now and I'll stop the recording. Do I have to save this? No, you can take it off. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/410_P/410_AUDIO.wav,1
411,17,1," person or okay no i was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual uh oh like the person yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah okay Okay. Okay. Oh, when I'm done. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions before we start. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are a privilege and a privilege. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? When did you move to LA? I moved to LA in the 70s. But I lived a lot of different places. How often do you go back to your hometown? I guess every few years, but I travel a lot. So I've lived in Africa, I've lived in Spain, Switzerland, Hong Kong too. Wow. What do you enjoy about traveling? Different cultures, food, music, rituals, everything, the smells, the colors, makes you feel alive. What was your favorite trip? I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips? I lived in Kenya for about a year. I'd say I love horseback riding, so when you're viewing other animals, when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing so many animals yeah in kenya um Probably when I went to a Maasai village, and I happened to, I used to live in Hawaii, and I had been to Tahiti, and I was wearing one of those paraus that are hand-painted, and I had it tied over the left shoulder with a twisted knot, and I happened to enter a Maasai village for the first time that day, and I looked all around, and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed messiah and uh and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have like weighed my ears straight down and um and then they gave me some bracelets and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper messiah so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know awoken. Yeah. That's great. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I think it's not so clear cut. I think a lot of people are a hybrid of both. I mean, I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen and very courageous at other times. Probably one of my best virtues is I'm a very gutsy person so when I really feel passionate about something, I risk everything to go achieve it sometimes. I believe that usually, well, I make decisions very quickly. And I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly. And he said to me, tell me how I can make decisions quicker. And I told him, I said, well, in each case, you always have no choice. And he says, what do you mean? There's hundreds of choices. And I said, not really, because it's gut wise, there's only one. And it doesn't really matter. You waste time, physical energy, emotional energy, mental energy, reflecting all of it. When gut wise, you always know what the choice you really want to do is. And it doesn't matter whether there's a 98% chance of failure. Even if there's a 2% chance of success, you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice because who cares if you remain unscathed but it yields no joy sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii But it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Pardon? You said you put your fish... What do I do when I'm annoyed? I think when I'm annoyed sometimes I... It's because sometimes I need to be a little more patient. I guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react. You have to have more empathy. How hard is it? Not really. I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much because you're put in other situations where you're forced to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from yours different situations I've been to so many third-world countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is Last time I argued about something. God, I'm trying to remember. Oh, I think it's when somebody didn't respect, actually, my privacy in something. Can you tell me about that? Uh... Oh, I know what it was. It was somebody who belonged to the Scientology faith. I inherited I inherited possibly a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I have like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photo sensitive and I had an you know an episode where I was I had big flare-up and I wasn't really feeling well. I felt flushed and everything. And the Scientologist tells me that I needed to be audited. And he said something about, are you aware of past lives? And I had told him that I was Buddhist. And I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion, at least you should find out the other person, what religion they are, just to even be informed to be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware that um about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness um resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick, make you even have cancer. Yes, we believe that. And we also believe, I said, that, you know, that you have the power of each person has a godlike or a Buddha-like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself, even when I'm on the verge of possibly being, I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years. I don't have a tendency to be sick at all. And a large part of it is I think when I think I'm on the verge, I take sort of like, and I did this even when I was a child, when I was seven, I would fall down, I have my boo-boo, and I would say I would have the good part, you know, help the bad part from a simplistic way in terms of a child. And I would actually, even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I concentrated healing and when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that did you hurt last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but uh um but I was just I think annoyed and irritated only because the Scientologist told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was um whether he took 20 40 courses or whether i've been practicing buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years or whether somebody's been practicing some type of christianity for 50 years and been sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so i just was thinking that is the antithesis of somebody who says they were enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with it but then it was was so pompous that I became irritated especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out to him because I just didn't even want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get hip surgery I mean I believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he's flippantly said well you aware us scientists believe that past lives can also affect you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are kind of like well known for you know believing in you know cause and effect and past life situations and i found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but um you know i i you know i i just didn't you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it but other than that i mean i don't um uh sometimes to have a little more tact, I guess, in terms of patience. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I can think of that right away. I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital. I'm sorry. How did you decide to do that? My brother was supposed to be the strong one, supposedly, because he is in the medical field. So my sister and I said, well, you know, he's the medical one, so he's probably used to seeing this all the time. time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept you know um you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know it was after a while the um you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular uh you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would have been you know negligible yeah it was I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've I've had to block them. I really don't know what it is within my makeup, which doesn't make me feel like I need to. I have friends that have unmitigated issues, which they're not even aware of, that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear. and for some reason I feel blessed that I don't really, I can't really even think of something that, I mean, I've had some bad situations happen to me, but it's not that for some reason they've traumatized me in affecting, you know, my behavior where I would, where I block it that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason. So I really can't think of anything. I mean, there's bad things that happen and I know that they are, but it's not like I feel like I, it's necessary for me to block them because I've been able to, you know, um, except sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? pretty easy. I can usually make myself sleep in any situation. If I have a one-hour flight to San Francisco, I could just kind of lean against the window with a pillow, have the blanket over, and even an hour flight pass out before the plane is even taken off from the ground. So I have literally, when I've had little sleep, and I'm very high energy, so I don't really need that much sleep, but say like if I'm in Africa in a bumpy, potholed, unpaved road, and I suddenly decide I need a few moments of sleep, I will just prop something up, put my elbow against the window and say, I think I'm going to take a nap for 15 minutes, go like this, and through the jostling, I could just take a nap for 15 minutes, so I don't really have that problem. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? Okay, pretty okay. I mean, I could deal without the skin flare-ups, but, you know, from the photosensitivity and all that, but other than that, I'm in pretty good spirits. Have you ever studied, what? I still couldn't hear you, I'm sorry. Have you ever studied changes in my behavior? What was the word? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Uh-uh. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, I don't know, just with friends and everything, just even this past week, just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having a great meal, laughing, just, you know, having a good time, listening to music. regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about you know it's funny i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in my life that have happened i've also been opened up experiences that are, that are also great, that I have not overlooked. For example, I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole savings that I've had to start all over again, and sometimes people say to me, like, are you sure you're okay? Are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if I was you know because my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way um and uh he stole essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and he got sent to prison the FBI was involved Interpol was involved I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth and um uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't gotten involved with him in business i wouldn't have had a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich, I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish, German, lived in Europe if I had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off. And there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that I developed during that period of time. And in a way, it was a totally different life, a different world that, that would, you know, that I would have never had the chance, you know, to live through if I had not been involved in my, you know, but of course it cost me financially. And, but then again, I've always been a type of person who, you know, money isn't everything. And I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it. So there you go and for example one of my favorite times in my life probably when i lived in kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad vision that i may be looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it's not like that at all but and you'd think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that I mean actually and I really didn't have you know that much many many material goods at the time I mean I had the blast I had probably the one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya the same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16, to live your life with passion. And again, like choose the way I was saying earlier about making decisions. You have to make those decisions gut-wise. What will give you a sense of awe and wonderment? What will make you, give you joy? And you have to, it's regardless of what the percentages are. Even if you only have a 1% chance of success, you have to go towards that. because that's the only thing that will yield, you know, the happiness in your life. What are you most proud of in your life? The fact that I've adhered to that and been brazen, whatever you want to say, have the balls, the chutzpah, the kohonis to go ahead and follow my passions. And, you know, I guess people call them sometimes strong decisions. Usually decisions that are where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy. That's just Murphy's Law. That's just the way it is. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Please.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/411_P/411_AUDIO.wav,0

Well, both parents were, I got sick and got dementia, and, you know, one parent didn't remember who I was, so that part was pretty difficult. Wow. How do you cope with that?

Probably be more successful in business, be a little more outgoing. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Probably my boss. He's pretty condescending and really likes to belittle people and put himself as the king. So he says a lot of comments to build himself up and belittle whoever else is in the room. Oh, no. Can you give me an example of that? Well, usually when you go in, he likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business and then say things like, see how much better I am than you are?

413,42,1," Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Greenwich, Connecticut. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? I moved here in 2008, so about five years ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? I try to go back at least once a year. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Overall, I think I like where I'm from better than LA in general. Why? I think that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with, the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and it's less superficial. I understand. Why did you move to LA? I moved out here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Initially it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once. But then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally. What did you study at school? Fine arts and photography. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I was interested in photography since high school. I did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments, so I decided to pursue art. Are you still working in art? Yes, I have a fine arts degree that I got last year and... Awesome! Are you happy with your work? Awesome. Are you happy with your job? Yeah, I really enjoy working or interning in forensics. I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography. I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Can you tell me about that? Most of them live within the area or on the East Coast in general, so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible, which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Like what? I watch like Bravo TV, like the Real Housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm good I guess. I don't really have like a temper. If I'm having, if I'm more stressed out it definitely shows in my attitude but I don't really have like anger. Um, well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time, just like about like insignificant things. But other than that, um, I had an argument with my dad a few days ago. Can you tell me about that? There's been like some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter. Things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. So for like the 30th time he we were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I had told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend because of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I I don't care about having a relationship with her, so if she doesn't want to hear from me, you know, it's easier for me. Yeah. That sucks. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I mean, every time, I mean, it's been the same recurring argument a lot, and I wish that I could, sometimes I do, but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive a fight that I could just bite my tongue, but the thing is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that, like, will tick me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me, so he, so I kind of just, like, lose it and I can't really, like, not say anything. Yeah. I'm sorry. tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make um well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me I basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. So it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time. It felt like just like a progression of the next step. But looking back now, that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Well, I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral, which obviously it wouldn't change anything, but it wasn't, seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory. um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental um and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Usually it's easy. The problem is staying asleep. No matter how late I go to bed, whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m., I will be up like clockwork by 7.30 or 8 o'clock in the morning the latest every single day, and I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer. Are you triggered by something? No, I just, in the morning I guess I'm a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up. Like I just cannot stay asleep anymore, which never used to be a problem this consistent. But now it's, I cannot remember the last time I slept past 8.30 in the morning. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I mean, it just makes, if I have to do stuff during the day, it makes it a lot more tiring. But it doesn't really, I'm so used to it now, it doesn't really change my mood. It's just part of every day. I don't know, I kind of just feel very, like so-so. Just no extreme highs, no extreme lows. It's kind of one note, bland. Have you had a study to use in your behavior or thought process? I mean, nothing like lately, like recently. It's just, I would say over a period of years, I've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, I have been diagnosed with anxiety. What got you to seek help? I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe. they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it, if they're open-minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing, then yeah. Do you still go to therapy now? No, I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid. Why did you stop? I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to, like, deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never, I mean, we just sat around and talked about my day. It wasn't, I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time, so I didn't really get much out of it. I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Well, I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, I can always just, we save up our money so it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. I just, every morning we wake up, we hang out, just enjoy the day. That's great. in general um i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as like the tight-knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College back home or, you know, any other school with the name college at the end of it. I didn't realize until, you know, the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school. Like you, you can't, I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went. So it kind of created more problems for me. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? How would your best friend describe you? um my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things I just I am very shy and don't really speak much um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that. Nice. Yeah. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm very caring. I'm a very good judge of character, which I mean, I consider it to be a quality for myself. I'm very, I mean, I'm not very affectionate. I'm more, I mean, I guess, I guess so. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Thanks. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/413_P/413_AUDIO.wav,0
414,67,2," Okay. Okay. So let me just check your microphone. I think it looks good. Oh, yeah. It's going to get in the way. All right. And now I'm going to give you the doorbell. Okay. When she's done, she'll let you know, and you can press that button. Okay? Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Burbank, California. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather, of course. I think everyone likes the weather. It's not too city, like Chicago or New York. It's big enough, we have beaches, we're not landlocked. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Sometimes the smog, the traffic, the fact that I've just been here my entire life almost. Okay. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not enough as I'd like to. I go to school in Chicago and I've been to New York a couple times, San Francisco, and I took a road trip across the country. That was cool. I saw a couple states. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing new places, going to landmarks that I've only read about or seen pictures of. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago, taking Route 66, and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen, probably. Awesome. How did you feel in that moment? Happy. and then just happy. It was beautiful. It was nice. I haven't felt like that in a long time. That's so good to hear. What did you study at school? I was studying film. Cool. How did you decide to do that? It's just something I've always loved for as long as I could remember. And when it came time to start applying to schools, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. And I applied to Northwestern as a film student, and it just ended up being the right decision. That's great. What's your dream job? Ooh. I love making movies, but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera. So a comedian, a comedic actor would be totally great, but that's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot. I like being the center of attention, usually. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers and Tiaras and Duck Dynasty. Just TV programs where I really don't have to pay attention at all. I'm okay at it. I get really emotional really fast, but I'm usually able to keep my anger down and not, like, lash out at others and stuff. For the most part. Has that gotten you in trouble? Sometimes I get into, like, arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily. and I hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? my best friend Ryan I think and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and how we were going to go back to the way it was before. How hard is that? Really hard. He's my best friend, and I miss him. But we messed up, and it's just not the same. It's like not the same friendship. Me too. too many um i guess when i have a boyfriend and he is a girlfriend which was not okay i wish i would have just realized that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my breakup and then our friendship being really messed up I guess not spend as much time with him as I did being more assertive Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um. I guess it was in November. I was very depressed and suicidal. so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER and from the ER I had the choice to I don't know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though I felt like I didn't have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever can you tell me about that um it was awful it was in chicago and um it was scary and i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices. There were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary. I didn't know anyone, everyone, most of the people there weren't depressed, they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just, it was really hard for me. What made you decide to do that? I had been so depressed for like a month, I stopped going to my classes and work, and I told my teachers lies about being sick, and I just kept calling in sick to work. I dropped a class, and I was failing my classes and not turning in any work, and I wasn't talking to any of my friends, and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere. and I was just in a really bad place. And when I finally was going to kill myself, I realized I needed help. It was. I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then. and I got put in therapy for quite some time. So I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again. I just want to get better. So I had to do it. I had to get help. I do. I go once a week. I feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles so I have to I have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay she's not we're not that great together, but she's who I have right now. It's better than nothing. Not that easy at all. Ever since I got out of the hospital and I began medication for my depression, I just haven't been able to sleep well, falling asleep is hard, staying asleep is hard, have really crazy, vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing. Like what? um I guess just sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about or happening in my life but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom did we go here? did we do this? did this really happen? and it's usually no, you dream that sometimes I've gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up probably like two nights ago that is a hard question And I think in November, after I got out of the hospital, I finally had one good day. And my friend took me into downtown Chicago. And we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those big windows that you walk out on and see the city. And that was really cool. How would your best friend describe you? Probably super outgoing, likes to be the center of attention, funny, and a little bit crazy. Is there anything you regret? I try not to regret things in my life. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I would say that living is worth it. And just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it. Don't wait until it gets really bad. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. um i guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends maybe going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some tv have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies, I would like to do that in my free time, go for a walk, I don't know, go to the beach. Um, that is a hard question, I mean, I think I've done a lot of great things in my life, and I've achieved a lot but I think one of the proudest things proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like 30 push-ups and it was some guy I didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if someone helps him you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then I just decided to start doing push-ups with him and I just it wasn't because I wanted to get credit or because I thought it would make me look good I just did it and no one really knows about that but I just feel really good about that. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It was nice to meet you. Bye. Bye. I guess I pressed this button. Okay. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/414_P/414_AUDIO.wav,1
415,21,1," Okay. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious to talk to you about your influence and security behind it. I'm not a therapist, but I'm very learned about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions, but let's start. And please feel free to send me a message. Your answers are a privilege and a honor. Are you Yeah. I'm good. Michigan. Two years ago. Every three months. How does it compare to LA? It's more homey and country than fast paced and stuff Why do you live in LA? I work in the entertainment business so I had to be out here How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty easy because I lived in New York first and if you can survive New York you can survive LA What are some things you really like about LA? The weather of course, beaches. The people are much ruder in me than what I'm used to, but I like LA. What did you study at school? Graphic Design, Media Arts. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? In high school I was ahead in all my classes and credits so I had to take a college course. So while in high school I got a two year college degree doing it because I was good at it. Wow. Are you happy with it though? Yeah, but now I want to go into something else. What is that? I'm in school actually. I take online classes now for business management. What's your dream job? I am a really one day I want to own, me and my sisters want to own our own rental properties and like a real estate company. We own six houses now we bought with our college money and now we want to eventually one day own our own homes and apartment complexes. That's great. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about when you first. Honolulu and took then Humawi yeah and we met the people in Hawaii and they were so nice if I could live there I would um everything was memorable but probably jet skiing in Honolulu was very fun Awesome. Can you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the first page of Scream Saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best-served guide. What do you do to relax? Music. Music is much therapy for me. Can you tell me about that? Um, well, my family is very musically inclined, like my dad and my mom's family, so music has always been like that thing. No matter how I feel, if I put music on, it makes it much better. I'm pretty good. I used to box, so it let out a lot of frustration. So sometimes I do that too. I go to the gym and I do like a kickboxing class. But I don't, I never escalated to the point where I like blurred out or, no, I can control it pretty much. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Well, I live with my sister, so I argue every day. But it was over clothes. My sister and clothes. It's always clothes. Tell me about your relationship with your family. um my mother and my father are pastors of a church i grew up with two sisters and an older brother who was a cop and we're pretty close i have a nephew we're pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point when we lived in a when we lived in michigan my family is in michigan That's great. What's something you feel guilty about? Um, when I cheat, like right now I'm on a diet with my sisters, but last night I snuck and got McDonald's. So I feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and I cheated. But that's pretty much it. Tell me about a situation that you would see in a different way. Um, hmm. me and my when me and my a friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren't like we hit below the belt that we and we usually don't and we haven't spoken in like three months now and I know that it could have been prevented if we would have just sat down and talked to each other but it didn't make it that far so yeah Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Probably moving here. Moving to L.A. Because, like, I'm really, like, we're really close to our family. Like, I Skype with my mom and dad every day. So it was hard to go from there to here. and them taking care of everything to me and my sisters having to do it on our own it was much it was different oh my goodness uh my parents my brother my dad my mom my sisters my family I have a great family so my family definitely. Okay. Tell me about moving on or something that you would do to raise family. Um I want to say two years ago, three years ago my brother was shot on duty and he almost lost his life but he didn't and for some reason as much as I try I don't tell them this because I don't want them to be like I need to you know whatever but I always think about it over and over again and I'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years ago just the mere fact of almost losing him kind of yeah not easy I work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for a casting agent so I'm on call for her whenever so I never get a good night's sleep ever I know I'm a zombie I'm pretty much you would never know when it's work I'm professional so if I am tired they never know but I'm very annoyed and very grouchy when I haven't slept tired and I have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much but yeah very tired yeah definitely um I'm shorter with people like being in the industry I mean people don't really care it's all about self and when I first came here I had I had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here showed me that everybody's kind of out for self here even the like the other girls I work with so I've learned to like cut people off and be short with people when it's not really me, but I just see that's how you have to be. No. No. Um, last Saturday, I did a weigh-in and I lost seven pounds. I was like excited. So that was the last time. How are your best friends? I don't care too much. I think about others more than myself. So she'd probably say I care too much, I'm loving. I'm the person that every friend I have confided in, from best friends to just regular friends. So yeah, I'm the mom of my friends. Is there anything you would do? No, I don't regret anything. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 15 years ago? Never take no for an answer. What are some things you would say to yourself? I wish I could, well, I don't know. Personally, I want to lose like 20 more pounds. But just, I don't know, be a little more adventurous. A little more adventurous. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. I don't think I've had a time. Baby feel bad. No, I can't. No, I don't think I have one. I'm sorry. I don't think I have one. How many times have you done yoga? Oh, well, me and my sisters have just started with yoga. And we already do the beach like every Friday. But yoga is like our new addiction. So we do yoga. And we probably go to like a spa or something. That's an idea. Yeah. My job, my career, because I've gotten a pretty long way at 23, the job I hold. So I'm pretty, pretty proud of that. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/415_P/415_AUDIO.wav,1
416,24,1," it doesn't matter okay start the conversation okay okay yeah gotcha cool I'm doing good. How are you? Where are you from in the UK? Really? When did you come to LA? I think I've been here a while. How often do you go back to your hometown? How does it compare to LA? love LA for the weather. I see. Why do you live for LA? Family. I was a child. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It took a little adjustment, but not hard. That's good. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. I can't think of anything right off the bat, but I sure wouldn't want to leave. My family is here, so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave. What are some things you don't want to do? Traffic. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really, but I've traveled a little bit, yeah. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing new places, different people, the way they live their lives. I love to travel on the trip. I went to Monterey, California earlier, the middle of last year. That was very nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? That's a good question. I'm not really sure. I can't think of anything right off the bat, which makes me think it's kind of weird. What did you study at school? Astronomy. yeah it was I don't know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kind of just went down that path no there's not much job opportunities so it's kind of limited yeah it does What's your dream job? Can you tell me about that? out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know tracks a crowd but it's probably costly so I don't know if it's really plausible I'm definitely more shy but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people but initially I'm pretty shy I turn on the best thing, screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Good idea. What do you do to relax? A lot of times I try to just lay back and do some deep breathing, just kind of clear your mind, or maybe just watch a movie. Listening to music is good. Reading a book kind of just takes your mind away. Relax. How long do you do it completely? I've gotten much better at it. I used to have problems with that when I was younger, but I'm good with that now. I've learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations. You should think before you speak, that type of thing. When was the last time you argued with someone? When did you have? My ex-girlfriend, when we broke up about three months ago. Can you tell me about that? How did you feel when you met her? like yeah I guess everybody kind of sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and I'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you know of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kind of looking out for themselves but yeah Tell me about a situation where you and your friend were different. know reveal your emotions so much or that type of thing Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made um leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was 18 this was a long time ago I went to school in San Diego and I immediately wanted to come back so I kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and I wish I didn't do that. I feel like I can contribute more to my family and my friends. I think I could do better. I think I sell myself short. Employment opportunities are hard to come by, but if I could find a good job, I'd be a lot more happy because I can provide for myself and others, so not be so much of a burden to people around me. Yeah, real difficult. It's good. It's very good. We're pretty open with each other, and I see my mom and dad and my sister quite often, so it's a good relationship. I mean, we get along very well. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's good. How easy is it for you to make a good sleep? What are you like when you don't sleep well? How have you been feeling lately? Have you ever been diagnosed with dyslexia? Have you been diagnosed with dyslexia recently? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. but really happy it's probably been a while probably like super bowl sunday i was with all my friends and we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy i wish i was more i guess stuck to my goals and I wish I had better drive to succeed I don't know I usually settle for less so I don't know I guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad don't really matter I kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that five ten years have gone by and you should have done something Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Tell me about an event or something that made you feel like something bad. I don't know. When I was in high school, I got into an argument with a friend and I drove my car too fast and it was in an area that I didn't know and I hit a turn that I didn't know was coming and I crashed my car. So I wish I didn't do that. But that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now. How do you feel right now? My parents, some of my close friends, I have a good group of three or four friends that have been positive influences. That's great. Yeah. How are your best friends? A caring guy, nice person, good heart, a little unmotivated, needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better, and passionate, I guess. Passionate in a good and bad way. Can you tell me about that? Well, I care a lot, and at the same time, sometimes that gets the best of me. Can you give me an example of that? I can't remember. Is that something you remember? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Tell me about something you would recommend that you really need. I don't know. Really enjoyed. I mean, I do things every day that I enjoy, but really enjoyed? I don't know. I cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room, so it was nice to shed some old garbage. So that was all right, but I don't know if I really enjoyed that, but I felt content after it. What is the most fabulous moment? Not much. It's kind of sad. I don't know. I think I could do better. I feel like I'm an underachiever, so not much. I don't know. What would you say is your job? because once you buy one line leads to another so I don't like that but yeah that's about it cool right on have a good day Hey, that was weird. I felt like I was in therapy. Should I take this off?",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/416_P/416_AUDIO.wav,1
417,39,1," All right, thank you. Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from right now? Los Angeles. Really? What do you think you'll like about LA? I don't know. What do you think you'll like about LA? It's kind of dirty, but it's to be expected from a big city. What did you do at school? The last class I took was a sociology class. I'm not really sure where I'm going with school, but I'm thinking about sex education. How did you make your education? I think that it's a really important job. I feel like because there's kind of a stigma, I guess, about talking about sex, it leads to a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies. So I feel like it's a very important job for the world. How far do you think? I don't know. Okay. I'm sure you can tell them, too. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Why? What do you mean? Do you think of yourself as shy or outgoing? people who I know well, like, who are closer to me, I'm more outgoing. Um, play with my dogs, uh, I don't know, uh, if it's a nice day I'll go for a walk. If it's not a nice day, or if it's cold out or something, then maybe watch a show on TV I like or read a book or something. I'd say I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? that I regret things, but I think there's a difference between guilt and regret. Like, I think guilt is more just like feeling bad, but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision, and I think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future, whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless. I regret not doing better when I was in high school I mean not getting better grades I regret like getting involved with certain people in the past but I'm not sure that's about it that I can think of right now yeah I mean I mean in the past yeah I could have made different decisions I mean obviously some things you know aren't entirely in your control but I'm not going to feel, I'm not going to regret things that I had no power over, so. Um, I'm not sure if I would want to erase it from my memory, but I wish that it didn't happen to me, uh, was a time that I was raped. I'm sorry, you're doing this. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you would see as very different. Hmm. I'm not sure. I can't think of any. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a pretty good relationship with my family. I wouldn't say that I'm really close with my mother, but we get along well. And I'm very close with my sister. We're basically best friends. That's good. Is there someone that's been a positive influence on you? it and she just did her best to raise me so I think she was a big positive influence. How easy has sleeping been for you? It's been easy lately. Sometimes I have trouble sleeping but lately I have had no problems. What do you like about sleep? It depends how long I've gone without sleep. I can just be anywhere from groggy to really on edge and extremely tired. I don't know. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I have been feeling pretty good. I have, like, general anxiety kind of all the time, but it's not as bad as it has been in the past. So, I've been feeling mostly pretty good. I think that I've actually been feeling happier lately. I wouldn't say that I'm like really happy all the time. I'm mostly just kind of like neutral, but I have been feeling more positive lately. I'm actually not sure if I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I know, I've been seeing psychologists for like, since I was 16, for depression, and I think my first psychologist, who I saw for a few years, thought that I had PTSD, but I'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis. Did you think you had a cognitive disorder from that? Um, I'm not sure. Uh, I'm, I don't know. Yes. Yes. How does singing break up with you? you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something. I mean, I think sometimes you can do that on your own, but talking to somebody helps, I think. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I'm not sure. I'm not sure I'm not sure How many times have you been here in a year? I think I would spend it mostly at home, but it would be sunny out and I would go outside a little bit and play with my dogs and I'd probably have my boyfriend over. I'd eat food that I like, like only food that I like, like my favorite foods. Watch a movie or TV show that I like. Just kind of have like a relaxing time, but that's nice. What advice would you give yourself to a person you love? I would tell myself to do better in school because throughout high school I was kind of an underachiever and I ended up going to community college on and off because I would sort of lose interest and then not do well, or as well as I could have. So I would tell myself to do as well as I could in school because I feel like I am capable of a lot more than I do and I think I could easily have gotten a scholarship if I had done well in high school. So I would just tell myself to do good in school and probably warn myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time. um hmm um I think I am proud of myself for not being um bitter and for wanting to uh Well, I am kind of bitter, yes, but I guess I'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place. Like, because a lot of bad things have happened to me and I try to instead of dwell on them, I try to, um, or I want to be able to make things better for other people. as much as I want to help, I guess, empower people to make their lives better. Okay. Okay, I think I've asked everything you need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye-bye. Bye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/417_P/417_AUDIO.wav,1
418,43,1," Can she see me? Yeah, so she'll ask you some questions, and then just talk normally. Okay. And then so I'm going to give you the doorbell right here. Okay. When she's done, you can step up. Okay. All right, thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask 50 questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are a favorite contribution. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I was born in Mississippi. Yes. When I was two and a half years old. But actually it wasn't L.A., it was Santa Monica. Yes. Never. I was only two and a half years old. I don't remember anything. What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you really like about LA? the pollution. Well, I studied a number of things at school. I studied, at one point I had major in public relations, journalism, specialization in journalism. Then I also study, I was a pre-law major and so I studied the law and then I also studied human services courses. That sounds interesting. What made you decide to do that? Mainly because I'm a people person and I enjoy helping people. That's great. What's your dream job? Wow, my dream job? Hmm. Hmm. My dream job. I don't really have one right now. Okay. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. And I can't even see your shoes. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? Listen to music, watch horror movies. I love horror flicks. And I have a fish tank too, so I like to watch my fish. I also like to play tennis when I can. I haven't been able to play lately, though, because of physical problems. Can you tell me about that? It's just that I had injured my ankle because I had anemia, and I got dizzy one night, and I fell on my ankle and on my leg, and so I'm just waiting for that to really heal. But I'm planning on getting back into tennis. It's one of the things I enjoy doing. It really relaxes me. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? I really don't have a temper. Over the years, I've learned how to control that. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Probably would have been yesterday, but there was no argument. And what was it about? Nothing that I can recall. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Something I feel guilty about? Hmm. There's nothing right now that I feel guilty about. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. Oh, a situation that I wish I had handled differently? I really can't think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision? Oh. Um, the absolute hardest decision that I ever had to make, um, was when my, uh, I have twins, twin boys, they're grown now. I had twins, twin teenagers, and I had lost my job, and we were living in a motel, and the rent for the motel was outrageous. I couldn't no longer continue to pay the type of money that they wanted, so I had to briefly put my son in foster care for a minute. That was the hardest decision that I had to make. Tell me about your case. It's schizophrenic and he had had, he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training for speech therapist and school officials. And he also lost his hair when he was four years old. But and then when he turned 14 the schizophrenia came up. So right now he's in a supportive living environment. He's 27 years old. But he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now. He had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication. and give him the medication and he hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever. So, but he's come to terms with that and we've all have come to terms with that and he's doing pretty good. That son, he's 27 too, as I said, because he's a twin, was living in Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to... So now he's in California too. Both are in California. Okay, so I feel very good about that. Yeah. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Well of grown children, yes. Of grown children, yes. No, no. No, no, no, no, no. No, I take that back. Not, it's not hard to be a parent of grown, of my grown children, okay, when they were younger. There were difficult times, okay, difficult periods, and just a lot of good times, too, but yeah, it was, there were some difficult times. Well, the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to, and that was when One of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and they were temporarily in, well one was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia. So I think I lost track of the question. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? the hardest thing about being a parent. At this point in my life, there is nothing hard about it. What's the best thing about being a parent? Um. The best thing about being a parent. I don't know, I guess it's just to see something that you created develop into a, you know, pretty decent human being, you know, a decent person. That's the best thing. What are some ways that you're different as a parent from your parents? Oh, a lot of ways. Well, actually, I didn't have two parents. I had a mother, and the father was never in, my father was never in the home, and he lived in another state, so I had no contact with him. But the thing that I do differently than what my mother did, she was a strong disciplinarian, both verbally and physically. And she had this tendency, which she outgrew, So she had this tendency to be very critical, okay, critical and opinionated and very religious and sort of looked at people who were not, and that was me, as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing. What was the other part? Another question? How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't get a good night's sleep or I don't sleep at all unless I take medication. And that's all there is to it. If I don't take medication, I don't sleep. I'll be up all night. I will be up for days if I don't take medication. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Man, irritable. I'm tired. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, lately, you know, just a little anxious really. I just recently made a move to a new apartment. It's a lot of expenses and new expenses and things like that. New furniture and new this and that that you have to get. I managed to do all that, but the whole thing was kind of stressful. They always pay off the money, aren't they? Yes. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not PTSD. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? That was back in, I think, 2004. What got you to see help? Because my life had gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or end something, to tell you the truth, yeah. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Yeah, I think it's useful. It's a good sounding board. Someone to throw your concerns out and discuss things that might be bothering you. Or good things, too. I think therapy with medication. What sort of cues have you noticed in therapy? Since I've been going to therapy, the changes, a lot of changes, I've been more focused, hopeful. It's just been a good experience for me, which is why I continue to go. That's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Really happy? Well, I can feel really happy by some occurrence. I can't think of anything right now just like that. And then I go back to how I was feeling. So I can't really pinpoint anything really. I mean, if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right, as opposed to things going wrong all the time, that makes me happy. Things go right. How about that? That makes sense. Mm. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something I did recently that I really enjoyed. You mean really, really enjoyed? Recently. Recently. Hmm. I can't think of anything. I don't have a best friend. My best qualities are that I'm an honest person. I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt. everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove it differently I'm very generous overly generous and I'm very I like to help other people I'm on a personal level I help people whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out. Is there anything you regret? Anything I regret? How so? Whatever comes to mind. There's only one thing I regret, and that is that after my twins became old enough to start going to school, at the elementary school level. I was taking some courses as a pre-law major and at that time I was married to their father who turned out not to be a good fit for me And because of the stresses involved with him, you know, knowing that that was going to end and I was going to leave him, I dropped out of college. So that was my biggest regret. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay in school, no matter what. Stay the course, no matter what. that I'm a good person that I'm a good human being that's all okay goodbye aren't you going to go goodbye are you done okay That was weird. That was a little weird. I was a little nervous.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/418_P/418_AUDIO.wav,0
419,25,1," Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm good, thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in Mexico City. Really? Yes. When did you move to L.A.? About 34 years ago. That's a long time. Yeah. How often do you go back to your hometown? I try to go back once a year, but I haven't been in about three years. Why? I haven't had the time and I've traveled other places but I'm planning on going back probably next year. How does it compare to LA? Well I can't ever see myself moving back to Mexico City. It's a huge, huge city and I like LA more. There's more opportunities and I just feel at home here. Why did you move to LA? My family moved here. Like I said, I was very young and my parents moved to California to work and then we just stayed here. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I love traveling. I have not traveled as much as I would like to, but I do love to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? traveling? Just seeing new things, meeting people from other countries, just feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation. I just love being in other places. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. The last trip I took was a seven-day cruise, And it went to St. Thomas, Barbados, St. Lucia, St. Martin, and it was amazing. I would love to do that trip again. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think going to Mexico the last time I was there. I went to the pyramids, Teotihuacan, and I had not been there in many years. and it just was amazing to see the pyramids, and I can't even imagine how they were able to build such great structures. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I consider myself more shy. Why? In social situations, I kind of feel uncomfortable. I'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations. If people come up to me, of course I'll talk to them, but I feel slightly awkward, just kind of out of place at a party. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? I actually studied history. Awesome. How did you decide to do that? I've always been interested in history and I just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course U.S. history, so I'm very into history. Are you still working in that? I'm actually working in the education field. What's your dream job? my dream job would actually be traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel that would be my dream job because I would get paid to travel and it's something I enjoy to do doing so I would love to do that as a job sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax um i love reading and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath and I also like going to the gym that helps me deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though I'm exercising. That's great. How are you at controlling your temper? I used to be not very good at controlling it. When I was a kid I would get mad very easily and And sometimes as an adult, I still get angry easily, but I've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts, things like that. When was the last time you argued with someone? The last time I argued with somebody was probably about a week ago. It was my best friend, and she actually has kids. I don't. And for some reason she thought or thinks that I think I'm a better person than she is. And because I went to school and she didn't and she's home with kids and, you know, I'm able to do more things. I don't think I've ever made her feel that I and I definitely know I don't feel like I'm better than her. But for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. the two of us and I wish I had been able to just stay calm and maybe asked her to call me later once she calmed down instead of just continuing the argument um I was angry at first but once we hung up I felt really bad about the situation I felt that maybe I could have just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly instead of yelling at her too. I see what you mean. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Oh, wow. That's a tough one. I think, gosh, I think one of the hardest decisions I've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years, although I knew that it was the right thing to do I was kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and I kind of felt by ending the relationship I would have wasted those last seven years of my life so it was a pretty tough decision to make but I realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and I'm actually glad I did because then I went on to meet my husband. Aw. That's great. Thank you. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Well, about, I would say, maybe 15 years ago, I was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and they invited us back to their place and I really didn't want to go because I didn't know these people and I mean I knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and I wasn't the one driving so I decided to just go along with them and back at their house, one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and tried, I got scared, I yelled, he tried to choke me and I thought I was going to die right there, I thought he was going to kill me, but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left, so it could have been a worse situation, but I still think about it and wish that I could erase it from my mind. Yeah, that sounds really hard. It was. Tell me about your relationship with your family. We have a pretty good relationship. I am close to, I have a sister and a brother. My sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older. And we get along pretty well. My sister and I used to be best friends, but then we grew apart. and then now we're actually closer, I think, than ever. And I have a pretty good relationship with my parents. My dad still treats me like I'm a little kid sometimes, which annoys me, but I think we have a pretty good, solid relationship. That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I usually wake up a few times throughout the night. so I think it's rare for me to sleep the whole night through ever and I do feel a little like tired in the morning when I wake up it's hard I'm not a morning person definitely so yeah it's kind of hard to get a good night's sleep I don't know it I have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes I have bad dreams or I need to get up to the restroom. But yeah, I don't remember the last time I actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once. How have you been feeling lately? Emotionally, good. I'm actually on vacation right now from work, so that's really nice. physically I feel good I haven't been to the gym in a while so that kind of makes me feel bad because I like working out but health-wise I'm good okay have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD no have you been diagnosed with depression no Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Nice! How would your best friend describe you? me as a good, caring person, patient, very shy. She'd probably say too that I have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors because I'm always doing things for other people. So yeah, that's how I think she would describe me. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I was more outgoing. I wish that I, what else? Definitely more outgoing so I could have more friends. I don't have a large group of friends because I am very shy. I also wish that I could have more patience than I do. Sometimes I'm very short of patience. And I wish I could find a better job so I could do more traveling. Is that something you regret? Yes, I actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree. and I really wish that I could have, you know, taken care of it a lot sooner than I did. And I also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I would have told myself to stay focused on school, that going out and hanging out and just, you know, going to parties. was not as important as I thought it was and that my education should always come first. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud that after so many years of not being in school, I was able to go to UCLA and get my degree. Yeah, that would be my proudest achievement. That's great. okay thank you bye Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/419_P/419_AUDIO.wav,1
420,24,1," Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk to people in faith and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to contact me. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes, I am. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Um, I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Chicago. Really? When did you move to LA? Um, back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit. How often do you go back to your hometown? Haven't been out there in over 15, 16 years. Wow. Why? Um, kind of got stuck out here. Then I had my baby and I just stayed. How does it compare to LA? Uh, different food. Um, the people get along way. Um, how do I get it? It's kind of a culture shock. Can you tell me about that? Out there, just on the food basis, they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer. But out here, they want to go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lot of money, so they just make the money. My parents had business out here. How easy is it for you to get used to living in LA? Um, not hard. I could get used to anywhere. That's good. What are some things you really like about LA? The views in the ocean. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Just a splitting of people, that's it. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Just a few places. What do you enjoy about traveling? Getting to see different people and learn how different people get along and interact with each other. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. I remember a trip years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother. Nice. What are your most memorable experiences? Awesome. What did you study at school? Everything. There's not a subject I don't like. What's your dream job? Um, actually my dream job? Working with computers and helping people. Really? Why? That's where my heart is. I like computers and I also like helping people. That's great. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I meditate, um, work out, I run, I walk, um, I write, read. Uh-huh. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? In the median. Okay. How are you at controlling your hunger? I'd say very good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Oh yeah, that doesn't make it seem that good. Last time I argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur towards my wife. Oh no. How did you feel in that moment? angry, upset, hurt, disrespected. And especially when I went up there to treat the person, actually I was treating them with dignity and respect and trying to help the person at first. I'm sorry to hear that. No problem. People are people. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I had a chance in school to really go a lot further than I did and I let something very small and meaningless stop me in the pursuit of it. What made you decide to do that? Um, ignorance, for lack of a better word. Have you done anything to avoid it? Now that I think back on it, I could have done a whole lot to avoid it, but I was just young and foolish. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. To start loving again. Um. As much pain as I've seen in the world. Can you tell me about that? Um, a compilation of all the events, just different bad things that I've seen. Like, if I could change it I would, but sometimes I guess things are there for a reason, even Even though we may not understand it. I see what you mean. What's something you feel guilty about? I have no answer to that. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. um blood family really don't talk um my wife don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that i'm doing everything in the world but that i'm not and really i don't understand i know my daughter loves me but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not Why? Tell me about your kids. I love my daughter. She's an angel. I cut her umbilical cord. I went out there and put on her first shirt. I seen her come out. She looked at me right out the stomach. She was fighting with the doctors. Wouldn't let them touch her a bit. I talked to her. I told her to calm down. I told her it was daddy. She looked up at me, grabbed my fingers, and like just calmed down and just let them do everything they needed to do. No, it's constantly changing tasks. What you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that. It's constantly, what is a better word for it? Adjusting. Yeah. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing I would probably say is scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for not learning the wrong lessons. What's the best thing about being a parent? Seeing a baby smile and appreciation. What are some ways that you're different as a parent from your parents? I try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees. Can you give me an example of that? When I was younger there were a lot of things that I seen that no child or adult should have seen. And when I grew up I swore to myself that I would always take care of my child and I wouldn't disappear or let her be around things like that. Okay.

No, now I'm a stay-at-home mom. Tell me about your kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? What's the hardest thing about being a parent? But the hardest thing, I think, is to guide them emotionally, to help him through things that he's having a hard time with, feeling like I don't have all the answers. What's the best thing about being a parent? Just seeing them grow and experience new things and learn about life and the world. It's just really, really cool. What are some ways that you're different as a parent from your parents? Tell me about your relationship with your family. are dead. I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died. I have a sister and a brother that actually, I don't know where they are. I don't speak to them either. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to listen to music. Like what? I listen to all sorts of music, but my favorite when I'm relaxing is 80s music. cheesy but true how are you at controlling your temper? it depends on who I'm with if I'm with my son I can control my temper if I'm with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don't so so When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Can you tell me about that? He told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her. Yeah. Really angry and just really hurt. I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died. I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage. What made you decide to do that? Because he was cheating on me. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. That would have to be... Well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory, because it makes me who I am today. So I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase. I don't get a good night's sleep it's not easy I wake up a lot in the night I don't know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I just don't know What are you like when you don't speak well? Grumpy, irritable. How have you been feeling lately? Grumpy, irritable, down, mixed with anger. Can you tell me about that? it's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. How do you cope with that? I just keep it inside.

Is going to a therapist helping you? I have gone to therapists and no, they don't help. Can you tell me about that? Well, some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything. You know, if I wanted to talk to myself, I would. Others give advice that I think is just not good and not on point. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. It was probably this morning I was playing with my son. How did you feel in that moment? Just really happy. I wasn't thinking about any of the other crap in my life. I could just forget it. So I was feeling really, really happy. How would your best friend describe you? What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Is there anything you regret? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? It would be to not give my life over to one particular person, which is what I did with my husband. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son, hanging around the pool, having fun, going out to dinner. Two of my friends, two really good girlfriends, I think, have been really positive influences in my life. her life is worse than mine but we can always commiserate together is just really positive she's always happy, always up, always looking to the bright side so that has helped me a lot That's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? My son. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I went over to a friend's house and we had movie night. We watched a grown-up movie and had dinner and wine. and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed, fun evening.

422,25,1," What is my hair doing over there? Will I see myself again? Nope, you can. Oh, okay. Now it's a little better. So this is mimicking her actual position? This is actually just a computer character that can be controlled in the other room other room by someone. So it allows someone to have a conversation kind of through her. Okay. And then I'll tell you a little bit more about how she works afterwards. All right. So I'm going to give you the doorbell. When she's done, just push this button up. Okay. Thanks. Hi. Hi. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions, then start. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are full of confidence. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? That's good. Where are you from originally? Originally, I'm from Korea. Really? When did you move to LA? When I was a year old. You were very young, weren't you? Yes. How often do you go back to your hometown? Almost never. I've been to Korea once. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture has a lot of things to do with the food. the food. There's a lot to like. What are some things you don't really like about the way you live? The traffic. It seems like we're having a lot of economic difficulties and the parking tickets are super high. Sometimes I'm really annoyed by our government. by your shoes did you say by your shoes your shoes aren't showing um i have traveled a bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about one of your trips. was kind of like a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days and that was really interesting um you know of course it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of the company which was real fun and um after singapore we did some tours in Singapore. It was really, it was an interesting experience. It's really clean there and it's really, there's not a lot of crime, but the government is very, it's a little bit imposing, but it was very interesting. Then we went to Thailand and that was almost, it was really completely different because it was like jungle. We went to Phuket, it's a little island, and it was just, it was very primitive compared to Singapore, just in a lot of different ways. So it was very interesting and it was nice. Everything was really cheap. I had a massage on the beach for $8. It was interesting. Yeah, it was an hour for $8. Awesome. What did you study at school? Well, I'm in school right now. And I didn't finish school when I was younger because I had health problems. So here I am. I'm just doing my general ed right now. I'm going to SMC. That's great. Yeah, I'm happy. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job would be to be a veterinarian, but it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life, and also because monetarily it costs a lot. But that would be my dream job, working with animals in a veterinary capacity. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm right on the cusp. It depends on the environment and the people I'm with and how comfortable I am. But I'm really outgoing when I feel comfortable with people and I'll be really reserved if I'm not. That makes sense. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Well, I mean, aside from sleeping, I like relaxing things, like going for a bike ride on the Strand, or if I'm at home, just like reading. or a lot of times I can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but I'm kind of relaxing they're really good I don't have I would say there are certain things that um they can really like make me like when i see injustices or things like that then i mean i can really feel it but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or even you know yell argued I can't really say I have arguments. I mean, just like a disagreement or an actual argument. Like if we just... Well... I would say last summer when... I think it was after a baseball game. There was a group of us and we went to we went to have shabu-shabu after the game and I think and I don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like she's a good friend in some ways and she's we're we're actually kind of distant in other ways so I don't consider her um like someone that I would confide in and you know with any deep problems but um sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she doesn't have the same sense of humor I do so I think she had said some things to me during the night which kind of bothered me but you know I just kind of that's just how she is and then I guess I said some things that she felt were well she gets really offended easily I think but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we're friends again but like she never she never confronted me hardest decision Uh, it was leaving my ex-boyfriend. How did you decide to do that? Uh, well, it wasn't, it was a long time coming. I mean, I was thinking about it for like five years. Um, you know, he wasn't like beating me or anything. He was a really good guy, but we just had a lot of, we weren't always on the same wavelength. And we did have a lot of, like, disagreements. So I had thought about it and thought about it, and we were already engaged, but we had been together for a long time. So, I don't know, I was always, it was always on my mind, like, should I get married or should I not? And then finally, we were just always having, we were always, what's the word I'm looking for? We were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time. And then one day we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did. That sounds really hard. It was really hard. It was the hardest decision in my life, and I can say that definitively. But I think it was for the best. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. um probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in Nevada and when I when I I really liked my job I mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach and when I told them that I was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a different position, which was awesome. And that was really stressful for me because I'd already promised my friend to leave. I wouldn't have gotten the position, you know, offer if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there. It was really, really stressful, and I stressed over it for about three weeks until I actually left. and um when i went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were um you know it was a hard situation because she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion i was i was surrounded by mormons and i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there so i would say that's one decision it's it's just a a pivotal point in my life and I think that I really wish I had just stayed. Yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Well if you're going to erase something from my memory then I would probably say memory like really if if I could erase something from my memory what would I want to erase is that what you're saying I can't really think of anything I mean even like that that bad decision that I made you know it has value in it so i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then i would but i don't well if you're talking about being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but But I never feel rested and that's, it's a medical problem of mine. Can you tell me about that? Well, I always feel like I haven't slept for two days. And there are points in the day, I would say, during some days, there are points in the day where I really feel alert and alive. and rested, but they're short-lived. But I sleep a lot. How do you feel lately? Pretty crappy. Physically, pretty crappy. How are you doing? Well, thanks. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but that's usually what doctors, like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed. I'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed, but that's the first thing that they try and figure out. They've given me, like, depression drugs before, but they haven't helped with my sleep. but I do I do I would say I feel down sometimes well my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down I would say that I do feel down sometimes, a lot of times, but it's not, I would say it's reasonable considering the situations that I'm in. Okay. Are you triggered by something? They're just triggered by the fact that my health is not great, and it makes life really difficult. but I wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Oh, I mean, you mean for a long period of time? I mean, I experience happiness when I go out with friends or I go and find some great new dish I like. I mean, what type of happiness are you looking for? well I mean right now my friend just had surgery and so I'm staying with her this week I'm really enjoying it I mean even though we could never live together I could never live with her long term and I'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but I'm having fun and um you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her on her phone um yesterday because she's been paying too much for laser hair removal and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh it's a groupon deal so i mean you know there's little fun things like that How would your best friend be? probably that I'm I should ask her I don't know we go out so I think she'd say that I'm fun but she has mentioned that I'm a very private person and that I know I knew before she said that why um i have well i told you i have i have a lot of problems right now and so i don't really tell people about them um it's kind of a it's kind of a killjoy but also So people can feel, I feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have difficulties and they feel kind of just uncomfortable, like, oh, maybe they should help or they feel guilty, but they have busy lives. So it just kind of creates a gap. But I would say even before this difficult time in my life, I've been a private person. I don't know why. I think a lot. You know, I'm a deep thinker. And maybe it's just, you know, not like I feel abnormal, but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that doesn't seem appropriate to share with people. I'm not sure. What advice would you give yourself 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago. Oh. Well, one thing that I regret right now is I haven't really found somebody you know to spend the rest of my life with so I would tell myself to concentrate more on that because once you hit 40 it's really it's it's a lot harder What are you most proud of in your life? I would say that I persevered. I'm very proud that even though I have a lot of difficulties in my life, The fact that I'm making this commitment to go to school, and I'm doing it on my own, and it's kind of, if people knew all the problems that I have, they'd be like, well, why are you worrying about school? But I really feel that, you know, I'm doing this, and I'm really proud that even through everything, you know, I'm getting A's. That's great. Thanks. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye. Hi.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/422_P/422_AUDIO.wav,0
423,27,1," Okay. I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? Really? What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you don't really like about LA? Fickle weather, traffic, and litter. I have traveled domestically, not internationally. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing other places and how people live and the culture. I'd love to go on a trip. Awesome. What's your most memorable experience? What comes to mind? Nice. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, the reason why that memory comes to mind, because this weekend is Easter, and we usually would go down to Easter or spring break to Rosarito, Baja. What do you study at school? I have a bachelor's in communication studies. What made you decide to do that? because it's an open field, just doesn't deal with communication interactively, but performing arts, telecommunications, business, entrepreneurship. Are you still working in that? No, I'm not. I'm actually unemployed. What's your dream job? I think to own my business. That's my dream job, to have my own company. Can you tell me about that? I would like to open something like the telecommunications area as a business. Something to do online, online services. I like to make things with my hands. So my next venture would be to create all-natural soy candles, something in that area. Awesome. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? A mixture. Why? I'm a mixture of shy and outgoing because I have to observe people and crowds. And that's how I usually make a determination if I remain reserved or remain open. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I listen to like a meditation tape or I take a walk or go get a massage. Fair. Oh, man. Probably yesterday or this morning. Usually the argument is about me making myself clear Or me repeating myself twice No, it usually gets the other person in trouble Tell me about a situation that you wish you had done it differently I redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission and I had a warranty and I wrote to the department of consumer affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and I decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and I wish I would have taken the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs and because of that I took him to small claims court and I end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion. So I wish I would have taken the higher road than taking the lower road. What is something you feel guilty about? I don't tend to feel guilty about too many things. Hardest decision I don't know Financially Emotionally Emotionally letting go A past relationship It's the hardest thing I don't say the hardest thing, but it was a difficult thing. Can you tell me about that? Yes, it was a relationship of seven years, but that person has already moved on. So they want me to be in their life in hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship, we'll always have something to fall back on. Yeah, it is hard. Um, an event. Something that I can't erase from my memory. Um, I don't know. There's a lot of events that I just automatically erase from my memory. But whatever comes to mind, right? Probably the death of a relative. How did you feel in that moment? Alone and misinformed. Why? because I didn't know that they were that sick and I didn't know that their days were numbered. And I could have had more opportunity to spend time with them and make a better connection in the last days. I'm sorry, you know. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Um, it's fair to Midland. My immediate, I'm very close, but distant, not very close. My mother. Can you tell me about that? And yes, she's encouraged me to continue my education, to always fall back on my hobbies, hopes, goals, and dreams. She always encourages me to always stay aloof and out there looking for a better opportunity. and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other ventures. That's great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Easy. Easy. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling well. Have you ever studied music in a video or a podcast? Yes, a little stressed, but I'm trying to manage that. How do you cope with that? I leave the stressful environment. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? In the past. How long ago were you diagnosed? About three years ago. What got you into this? Because I was having issues in my learning environment. And I was feeling emotionally attacked. Can you tell me about that? yeah I was having a issue with a professor who was just very I don't know he had a very different personality and he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school How did you feel when that happened? I felt like I was in a dishonest environment. I felt like I wanted to switch his class and get into another class, but I had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester. I think through finding PTSD they were trying to link depression no financially I'm not capable and I haven't found a counselor who's willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues. I find that a lot of counselors, they listen to me, and then they laugh at me, and then they tell me the opposite of what I'm telling them. That sounds really hard. Mm-hmm. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy. I really don't know. That's a good question. Um. Just deal what I want. I just relaxed. I just relaxed and, you know, I don't know. Okay. How are your best friends for you? I don't have any best friends. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities that I'm hardworking, I'm reliable, I'm an excellent friend, I'm energetic, and I'm a go-getter. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Things that I wish I could change about myself Probably be less sensitive Don't take things so personally And Learn how to help myself before helping others Is there anything you regret? No, I don't have any regrets in my life What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? If I could have done things differently 10 years ago, I probably would have focused and studied more and less being out of the house and hanging with friends. What are you most proud of in your life? That I have a college education and I'm self-sufficient and I can pay my bills by myself and I'm alive. Goodbye. Thank you.

424,28,1," So where's my little button? I'll bring it. Oh, you'll bring it? Okay, alright. Gosh, you look so human. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. Okay. You're welcome. Hi. Hi. Yes. Yes. Today is a wonderful day. I am doing just absolutely marvelous. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio. I was raised in Tucson, Arizona, and came to Los Angeles when I was 16 years old. Yes. I've only been back once since I left. It's a whole other community. When I was growing up, I'm so glad I grew up there because it was a great sense of community, which I think we don't have here in Los Angeles. Why do you live so long? My grandmother died and left property for my father, so we came here to manage her property. How easy was it for you that you stayed on? It was pretty easy for me. I was still young, and it was easy to adapt. So I'm pretty good at meeting people. So that has never been a problem. I traveled a lot as a child, So I was used to moving and going to new places. That's good. What are you enjoying about family? Meeting new people, seeing new things. It's an adventure, and I like the adventurous life. What's your favorite trip? Oh, one of my best trips I had, it was in 19??????????????'m dating myself, but 1964. I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland, Ohio. and I went to an Indian reservation and I got a little note card about the reservation when I got back home I wrote to the reservation and I told him I when I went back to school in September I would have to write deliver a speech rather about what I did over the summer and I told them I wanted to talk about going to the Indian reservation and what they send me something and they sent me this huge kachina Indian dad and that that was a wonderful experience to have The thing is worth now, if I still had it, I found out like a quarter of a million dollars. But that's one of the best things. I can be a little bit of both. I'm pretty, when I have to be, I can be outgoing because I'm good at talking to people and meeting people. But sometimes I have a little bashful sf me too. So it's a little bit of both. What did you study at school? I studied business administration with an emphasis in marketing and advertising. How did you decide to do that? Well, I really had started in computer science, but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't what it is today. And I was good at it, but it wasn't any interaction with people. And I love people, so I wanted something that would bring me interaction with people. So I went into marketing, and I was working for a TV station where I was going to school. So that fit in line in marketing and advertising. That's great. Are you still working in that? No, now I'm a photographer. I'm a celebrity photographer. I shoot a lot of stars. I shoot on the red carpet. I shoot a lot of special events. And anything else, people will pay me for it. How hard is that? It's not hard at all. It's my passion. I love it. It's like not working. I'm in my dream job. I just need to get more jobs that pay me well because there's a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of things, even for free, to get known. So it's a building process of relationships. So I'm still in that process of building relationships so that I can get more paid jobs. But this is my dream job. I love what I do. Okay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fist and scream. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do around it? Well, now I'm really back into it. I used to do it a while, and I got away from it. But it's meditation. I practice meditation. I try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before I go to sleep. I work with Oprah and Deepak Chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation, and I use that to calm my body. I can really control my temper. Sometimes I get set off, I guess, like any other human being, but I work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate temper and personality. When was the last time you argued with somebody? Oh, well, I argued with my daughter the other day about something I said, and I did not mean to say it to hurt her, but it obviously did. And we argued about what my intentions were, and my intentions were never to hurt her, and maybe what I said did. And that's what started the argument. How did you feel about that? Oh God, I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter. And I never wanted to hurt her. And I felt bad that she had been hurt by what I had said. So I had to guard my words and watch my thoughts. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I don't have much relationship with my brothers and sisters and mother and father. My parents live far away. So it's just my two daughters here with me. And we have a pretty good relationship. You know, we try to work. My daughter's a makeup artist. I'm a photographer. So we work a lot together in the industry. So sometimes I think we're up on each other too close. We need a little more space. Yeah, when I say the wrong things. No, it's never easy to be a parent. It's a work in progress. Making the right decisions about things sometimes. What's the best thing about being a human? The love, the feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being. What are some of the things that you're doing in your practice? I'm not as strict as my parents were. I give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are. I'm not real religious like they do, but I am very spiritual. So I brought them up different from me on the religious tip. And I listen more to them, I think, than what my parents did. It was you were to be seen and not heard when I was growing up, and I let my kids' voice be heard. What's something you feel guilty about? One night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don't want to go into details. I feel bad about that night. You haven't done anything to avoid it? Yeah, I could have stayed home. Tell me about a situation that you would see a different man. Wow, I'm trying to think about it in situations. Maybe the handling of how me and my husband divorced. I think I could have handled that a little differently. Well, I think we really loved each other a lot, and it was something that had come to an end, and the way we separated was kind of explosive. And I think both of us could have handled it better, but I think I played a part in keeping a lot of drama going. because I was hurt that we were breaking up and kind of devastated because I wanted my child to be raised with her father. So I think looking back now, which is, you know, hindsight is 20-20 vision, I could have handled things a little better. But what can you do? You do the best that you can at that time. If you knew better, you'd do better. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. The hardest decision I ever had to make was I was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane, had a stroke, was going to make a connection to get on the other plane and then go to the hospital, and a doctor was sitting behind me, and he told me that I could not get on that plane because I might have another stroke. That was a hard decision because I was in Dallas, Texas, all by myself. I did not, I mean, I was in there with an employee, but I would be left all by myself because my employees had to go on to Montgomery, Alabama, where we were headed. And I had to make a decision, should I stay or should I go? But my life was in the balance, so I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital. But that was a hard one. Overwhelmed. I mean, here I am on my way to work. You know, I flew to different states every week to help kids get admitted into college. And here I am on my way to work, and I'm on the plane, and I feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body. And I say my prayers, and I go to sleep. And then when I wake up to get off the plane, I can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment, which I did every week, so I knew something was wrong. It was when you see your life in the whole world in your hand, and you don't know what's going to happen next. So it was very disturbing, very traumatic, and you don't know what's happening to you. So the weirdest thing, riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance, that was a weird experience. But I'm here. I survived it. The doctor told me nobody survives a stroke on a plane, and I survived. So the universe wasn't finished with me yet. How easy is it for you to get into sleep? You know what? Sometimes I have a little problem with it, sleeping a little bit. Sometimes I get wired up. I get wired up just because I'm one of those real energetic persons, and I have to finish what I set out to do. And until I finish, I can't go to sleep. So sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep. Other times I can lay down and just go. But it depends on what's going on in my head. I'm sluggish. Probably a little on edge. But I try to keep an upbeat personality. I'm a real energetic person. So I try to. But, you know, if you're tired, your body is still talking to you. So. Lately, I've been feeling really well, except I've been having some problems because I have a, since I had the stroke, I have nerve damage in my hand and in my face. And so I just, it's, I thought it's been over a year since I had the stroke, but I thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't. But I'm so grateful to be alive that that is really minor compared to the bigger picture. And I wasn't, fortunately, I didn't lose my facial structure. You know, my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are. I still can use my hands. I still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is diminished in use. But I can shoot with my right hand as a photographer. So I can still keep doing my work. So, you know, I have to keep a good, upbeat energy going on for me to keep, for me to be successful. No, but I went through depression from being knocked unconscious five times when I was a school teacher. Every ball there was that you could name, soccer ball, baseball, basketball, name that ball hit me in my head. and I suffered from having like sleep apnea, not being able to sleep, from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head. So. Okay. Do you still go to therapy now? No, only, I don't go to therapy because I don't have any medical right now. So I'm not able to get therapy. They only offer that to people with medical. It's hard to get it. I'm not working right now because I'm still trying to get my disability so that I can get well because I want to be a fulfilled human being and I want to be totally in the system. It will be almost two years before I go for a hearing. So that's kind of depressing to think after all the years I've been working since I was 16 and it's taken me, it's been over a year, it was a year, I had the stroke February of and we are now in March of 2013, and I won't have a hearing until September 2013 just to tell me if I get the disability or not. That's been very depressing for me because I'm wondering where I lived off my savings in the last year, and I put my daughter through college, she finished, and now she's having to take care of me, and she's still looking for a job. My life is kind of up in the air right now because I'm wondering what comes next. And so I'm just praying for guidance. I feel happy every day every day I wake up and I can breathe and I can see and I can walk and I can talk and I can still shoot my photograph I'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive you know what I figure like what good is regrets you can't change the past, all you can do is change right here and right now. So just move forward. What advice would I give myself? Don't let anything get in your way. You know, keep a good personality and an energetic spirit and just keep pushing. How are your best friends? energetic, talkative, won't take no for an answer, follow through, reliable, good spirited, giving, loving. I'm most proud of that I have been able to find out my creative side. I've been a visual artist. I never took an art lesson before. I taught art. I was in my late 20s before I even discovered that I could draw and paint. I'm a doll collector. My creative side is what I'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative. I can, no matter what, even when I was still very ill from having a stroke, I could still go out and just go take pictures. And that was so soothing to my soul. that I'm glad that I have a creative side and that I found it and have utilized it. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything you need to know. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Is that it? Bye-bye. Bye. you know that was kind of therapeutic that really was therapeutic she was very nice too so i go back here okay oh okay i'm sorry",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/424_P/424_AUDIO.wav,1
425,27,1," Thank you. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm feeling a little tired and worried. Why? Well, I'm looking for a place to live and I don't have a job right now, so things are a little shaky for me. I'm sorry to hear that. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Where do you live? I'm staying with my son in Venice. How do you like your living situation? That's pretty good, but both of us need to have our own space, so that's why I'm looking for another place to live. I understand. Where are you from originally? Originally from New York, but I've been in California since the early 70s. That's a long time. Yeah. Why'd you move to LA? I moved to LA because I had been living in Portland, Oregon and I was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seemed like a good place to be. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It wasn't too hard. I met people right away and I just really like it here so it was easy to connect with people. That's good. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather is number one, like for most people. I love being near the ocean. I like the energy. I like the artistic culture. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, everybody loves the traffic, I mean loves the weather and hates the traffic, so I kind of feel the same way. sometimes it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not as much as I'd like. If I had more income, more funds, I would travel more. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, mostly I've been, I traveled, let's see, so my longest trip that was out of the country was to Mexico and I traveled, drove down with a friend down to Oaxaca. And the whole trip, we took about, I think we took us about four weeks going down and back from the Bay Area. Wow. Yeah, that was a fun trip. How did you decide to do that? Well, we'd been working together on the census, and she had made that trip a few times, and invited me to come along with her. What's one of your most memorable experiences? From that trip, I would say we were in Oaxaca for Day of the Dead, so it was celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in and everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away and they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it It was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that. Awesome. What did you study at school? Well, I was in the liberal arts program, but I only stayed in college for a couple of years. But I was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities. What's your dream job? My dream job would be personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them. How hard is that? It's hard to break into. I'm starting now very minimally with somebody who I'm doing more of a volunteer work with and I'm working on building up some of my skills so that I can be doing more of that. That's good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm fairly, I'm kind of a friendly introvert. So I'm, you know, I have no trouble meeting people. I don't hold back and, you know, I'm not shy at parties. I'll go up and talk to people. But I am overall kind of introverted, so I prefer one-on-one than big groups. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to watch, well, I like to watch improvement shows like on HGTV. I like to watch like remodel shows and see transformations or watch movies or read. And I play some solitaire on my Kindle Fire. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? get annoyed so much like when people cut me off or anything like that um but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or um you know when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent you know cut them off by mistake and you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry in return. Yeah. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Yeah, like I said, I don't really get into arguments. I was with a friend the other day and she got annoyed with me because she felt like I was correcting her so it wasn't really an argument but I had said something that she heard as a correction well it was a correction and she got angry How did you feel in that moment? Well, then I felt criticized, and I felt vulnerable. I wasn't, it was pretty uncomfortable. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. Well, in that situation, I didn't have to correct her. So I think that's something I'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right. So in general, I'm trying to catch that and just let people make mistakes without my telling them about it. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Boy, I don't know. I don't know that I've had that much trouble making decisions. well it was hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick and I had to give up a cat and I was moving once and that was difficult too well in the case of the first cat the one who was sick I decided when the vet said that he thought it was the humane decision And with the cat I had to give up. I didn't really decide. I was moving to a place where I couldn't take her. And so I found somebody who could take her. I see. Tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Let's see. Okay, that's tough. I don't really, the erasing from the memory part, there's nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory. I'm trying to think of something that I've done that I wish I hadn't done. Oh, okay, I remember something. There was a time when I was in a class at junior college. It was a film class. And I was the one who was, after we went out and did a little film project, and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week. I was the one who had the film, and through different things that were happening in my life right now, I never went back to the school, but I never brought them the film back. So all the work they had done, they had to do over again, and I still feel bad about that. Oh, no. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. Sometimes I wake up in the early morning hours and have trouble going back to sleep, but that's not very often. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling kind of tired and low-level depressed, like not feeling a lot of options. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? yes uh... there were two times there was one back in like nineteen seventy nineteen seventy two or three and then another time Oh, so the one with that, I've been in bed 16 years ago. What got you to seek help? Just feeling like there wasn't, you know, feeling that things weren't going to change if I didn't get some help and that if I didn't have to, you know, that maybe if I got some medication that would help me. in the short term. Do you still go to therapy now? I'm not going to therapy right now. Why did you stop? I was moving around a lot, finances. I wasn't really feeling the need. I'm starting to think it might be an option again. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I feel like therapy can be useful, yes. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, when I went to therapy, it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way I was feeling. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I was on the beach last weekend. It was a beautiful day and I was sitting in the sun and just relaxing. I had my notebook and I was doing some writing and I felt very happy and content. That sounds like a great situation. That sounds like a great situation. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm kind and compassionate, and I'm a good listener, and I'm intelligent, and I have good ideas. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? well I wish that sometimes I wish I was a harder worker I'm not really willing to take low wage jobs even though I need work so I just don't feel like I'm willing to do anything. And I wish I could act. I said I had good ideas. I have good ideas and I'm good at the onset, but I'm not really good on the follow through. So a lot of those ideas get started, but then I don't take them the distance. That's probably the thing I'd like to change about myself the most. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree, finish my education, and be willing to work a regular job and to start putting money away for my retirement. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud of my children and I'm proud of the friendships I have and I'm proud that that people do admire me and value my opinion. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/425_P/425_AUDIO.wav,0
426,70,2," Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. How are you doing today? I'm alright. That's good. Where are you from originally? South LA. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? The weather, the women, the opportunities. That's about it. What are some things you really like about LA? Racism, police brutality, injustice. No. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you use that a lot? Why? Okay. What did you study at school? Cool. How did you decide to do that? It was one of the classes I excelled in the most, so I decided to change it from business to psychology. Yeah, yes. No. It's on my own record label. It's moderately hard, but, you know, take it one day at a time. just I guess you know stay focused a little bit of both I tend to be shy and situations I'm not comfortable with or I'm new to and I'm outgoing in places I'm more comfortable with I'm getting better over the years. I think I'm pretty decent now compared to how I used to be. Yes, ma'am. Due to the lack of, I guess you could say, controlling my emotions, I have got incarcerated and sent to prison. Yeah. I'm not sure. I don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision I've made in my life. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? It was probably a few days ago with the girl I was talking to, and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness. Yeah. How did you feel about that? I'm frustrated because, you know, you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect, you know, the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship. And at the same time, when you have expectations, sometimes you kind of set yourself up a failure. So, you know, I guess I'm just learning. Tell me about a situation that you would see a man in differently. A lot of situations I would have handled differently. Probably the most recent was I got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated. And that made me, that's what sent me to prison and I had to do a lot more time. and if I handled it differently, I probably would have never went to prison. I probably would have been home a lot sooner than originally happened, yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. There are several events I wish I could erase from my memory. probably my first girlfriend she did something really extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it could have cost me my life I think that that's a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well a few fights I guess you could say shootouts getting robbed you know those things I think those inhibit me I guess to explore certain areas of life that I'm not comfortable with so those are the few things that would be nice if I could erase it completely yeah hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially a few women in my life or in my past probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well Tell me about your relationship with your family. It used to be rocky growing up, but as I got older and matured, and the certain experiences that I've been through kind of brought me closer to my family, so now it's pretty decent. It's pretty decent. That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say my mother. Yeah, my mother. Can you tell me about that? She had her share of experiences, negative and positive. I admire her, the struggles she's been through. she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her for raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could have been raised with so so she's kind of like a inspiration to me and other people as well so I was saying mother it's not easy so it's not easy I couldn't tell you I've always had sleeping issues I used to just take like over-the-counter sleep medication or NyQuil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really the Medicaid I don't know shit I don't know but I just stopped taking it because I don't like to feeling drowsy Not good at all. Yeah, I mean, I recently got released from prison not too long ago. I'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and I feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be. I feel like I could have made a lot more better decisions in my life. you know, sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that I've been through and the whole nine yards. So, yeah. It's all good. Yeah, this is true. Yes. About two and a half, three years ago. What taught you to seek help? Myself? I was just tired of not, I don't know. I guess school kind of made me seek help because I started to understand myself, how my brain works. You know, so I decided to seek help maybe to better my life. Yeah, you could say that. Are you happy with your life? Yes, I am. Are you still going to therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like you're a good investor? What sort of changes have you noticed as you've been doing this? Can you give me an example of that? Well, instead of just always reacting on emotion, no matter what kind of emotion it is, I step back and assess the situation to see what's the best way to react towards the situation. And by doing that, it has made me more mature, emotionally more mature, and just has a positive outcome. I was lying next to a beautiful woman who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous outgoing sometimes a little crazy fun that's about it nothing like I said earlier just hurting the few women that were in my life, my past, and my friends and family. That's about it. Oh, shit. School was really important. How I carry myself, the people who I surround myself with, and what I choose to do in my free time. Those are the few things I would tell myself. What are some things that you believe that you really enjoy? What do you know of something that you really enjoy? dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah okay I think I've asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me mhm goodbye bye bye you can check your computer We'll finish up with a poster about your experience.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/426_P/426_AUDIO.wav,2
427,26,1," Okay, that looks good. And then I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to move this and put it under your arm, just so you don't have to worry about it getting in the way while you're talking. How long do I talk to her for? She'll let you know when you guys are done. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, sure. I'm good, how are you? I'm from Florida originally. Where are you from? Oh, um, for work. How long have you been here? How do you think it was built? How easy was it to build it? What do you like about Hollywood? What do you hate about Hollywood? I've seen you travel a lot. Yeah, I've traveled a lot around America. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff. And I guess it's just relaxing and it's fun. I went to Canada once. My mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there. It's pretty cold. I didn't like that. About that particular trip? or, um, I don't know, she made us this, uh, like, Canadian food called, I think it's poutine or something, and so I guess that was a new experience. I try to get out in the sun, like go to the beach or something. Or read a book. Pretty okay. Depends on how bad the situation is. I don't know, like two days ago I was arguing with my sister about something. Oh yeah, I really don't remember. It was something stupid. I think she, I don't know, she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time. I don't know, I guess maybe I wish I just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly sometimes, but that doesn't happen really often. I don't know I guess think more before I talk and maybe I won't lose my temper something I wish I could erase from my memory I don't know I guess just like negative people or something negative people that I've met before I guess I just want to erase the thought of meeting them. Um, well, I had, like, friends that were just, like, not very good company, and they were just very, not very good influences, so, yeah, I would just want to erase meeting them. I'm not friends with them anymore, so. My family is a positive influence and my friends now. How many of your patients have you seen? How many of your patients have you seen? I don't know. I guess what I wanted to study in college maybe. It's not that hard, but it's a big decision. Computer science. Yeah, a little bit. Not as much, but a little bit. How did you get into it? Did you have a degree in it? What's your dream job? How hard is the job? I fall asleep like within five minutes depending on how tired I am. I'm very irritable. Yeah, I'm very irritable and not good to be around when I'm tired and I can't focus. I've been feeling good, fine. No. No. No. The last time I felt really happy... I guess like a week or so ago I went to um I went to where did I go I went to this event downtown it was like a art walk thing so it was exciting Thanks. Oh, just like different art galleries and stuff downtown. They're just exhibiting their work and I don't know, it's just interesting to walk around and see all of that. I think I'm generous, patient, I think I'm a good friend, I think I'm hardworking, and what else? Yeah, that's it. I wish I was more outgoing, like, more sociable person, and, um, I don't know, and I wish I was like I guess not um not easy to anger like get a temper or something oh no not in trouble it's just sometimes it's not pleasant for people um getting a having a temper I've never gotten in trouble I can't think of it. I guess I was in an elevator one time and this person was running towards it and I was trying to hold it for them but I couldn't reach it in time and they started cursing me out so I felt really bad because they probably thought I didn't try to open it for them but yeah. yeah it was sad what do you think of your friends? um... can you say I regret? not really I, well yeah I regret um... not contacting like old friends that I knew so I guess yeah maybe I'll do that in the future how do you know them? I know them from like elementary school. Yeah, but we lost contact through the years. Because I switched schools. For now? Okay. I don't know. I guess I would just say... well learn as much as I can and I don't know just don't hold back so much with like like not being outgoing and stuff I guess I just tell myself to be more outgoing how do you guess things? I think they'd say the same thing I said earlier that I'm generous, patient hardworking kind I hope they'd say that I am proud of my intelligence okay okay bye take care That was weird.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/427_P/427_AUDIO.wav,0

I haven't really thought about it. I can look at your shoes. Nah, I don't travel like that. I don't know, maybe money issue or something. If I have money, yeah, I'll go all over the world. probably um outgoing depends i guess i don't know about what shy or outgoing what outgoing you could be outgoing a party you know like you're already out there so you can be shy yes you're going to a party good probably um my girlfriend because i miss work because i just feel lazy i was like whatever you know i just didn't want to go and i i do what i want i just didn't go no not really she's already as long as we have the building rent paid don't worry guilty probably nothing I guess I should have gone to work. Damn. Damn, I get raised from that. Probably bad friends that I've met, you know? Like friends that trick you, you know? That say that... That they just trick you. Friends that deceive you, I guess. okay like um my friend told me that he had a good job at some college place so he told me to to he's gonna give me hired there and give me direct deposit but then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account so probably moving out and in my mom's house yeah I haven't really been around like a big decision like that. I want to be in my own space, you know, my own life. I want to do what I want, come home when I want, leave when I want. Yeah. We're all close. We're all, you know, we hardly argue we're always around we always see each other my mom my dad my brother how they were positive in my life well they're always there for you know whether you have financial problems they're there they help you out whether you're sad they know it you know and they blame what's wrong you know just go out and eat somewhere just to cheer you up they're your family and they're always there to motivate you and keep you going. Easy, actually. Yeah, pretty easy. I'm sorry? I haven't noticed, but maybe probably the same. I don't think sleep does affect you, but I don't know. maybe more tired but I don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that good everything's great maybe that I want to know like start a new business business or something well like my dad um he wasn't around for a while but he just got back and he actually opened up a shop and he's getting a lot of customers so it seems that his business is growing so I'm probably gonna learn learn mechanic like like I was saying earlier that's cool I don't even know what it what is that no nope sorry yesterday and last night because i got a new game y'all not funny No? No? I don't think nothing. Everything's fine, you know? Thank God everything's good right now. I don't think there's nothing to change like that. Maybe a better job. Well first of all I don't even have a job. So I guess to change I'll get a job. Nah it's hard for someone to put me down like that. to be separate and responsible as well at home resting and then I caught some friends over they usually do come over barbecue whatever comes to mind you know we're just there in my house because i have a nice backyard because i just moved to this new house so so far each yeah so each weekend right now we just people come over family come over and we pretty much just barbecue there just hang out my sister's birthday party it was on saturday it was fun it was a lot of dancing you know people I saw family that I haven't seen for a while so I enjoy doing that probably that I was like I was able to help my mom throughout because she was going through a really hard time my mom you know for most nine years because she was having hard trouble paying bills and rent so I I'm proud that I was able to help her even though I could only gifts so little but she at least we're all still good you know and we're still alive and everyone's still blessed um being around my family music music always put me in a good mood any kind of music even if it even if it's depressing music it's too it's gonna get me happy No problem, anytime.

429,21,1," I look like a cancer patient. Okay. Okay, so now I'm going to leave this here, and when she's done, she'll let you know. You're going to push this button to let me know. Okay. I'm good. Yes. I'm good. Iowa. When or why? 2001. How often do you go back to your hometown? Holidays and special family events. How does it compare to LA? It's much better there. Why do you live in LA? And I got into UCLA, went to UCLA for three years in their screenwriting program. It took a long time. It was difficult. Just the getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living. I see. Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Hmm. Variety. There's a lot of variety here. I like that. What are some things you really like about LA? The obvious. Traffic. I understand. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Do you travel a lot? Why? Okay. What did you study at school? How did you decide to do that? know something so it was very difficult very difficult but I did it why it fascinated me I didn't want to be intimidated by it oh yeah oh yeah What's your dream job? How hard is it? outgoing it depends on the circumstance it's not a catch all it depends on the moment What do I do to relax? I swim. Swam? Last time I swam? Last Friday? Yeah. Last Friday? Yeah, last Friday? What do I do when I'm annoyed? Swear to myself. Pretty good. Pretty good. Takes a lot to get me to express anger. But I do. It was in traffic, actually. So probably two weeks ago. So in traffic. Sure. I'm just waiting for the light. And some guy in a pickup is honking at me. I'm like, so I honked back. So he didn't like that. And he pulled up alongside me. I have no idea what his problem was. And we had a few words. Yeah. I mean, I have no idea what I was doing. Wrong. Just waiting for the light. Guilty. That's a strong word. I don't know if I feel guilty as I feel remorseful about actions or words said and done in the past. They come up. Oh, just past interpersonal reactions with friends or family. It'll just hit you one day. You're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason, and just out of the blue, it hits you. I'm like, oh, why did I say that? Why did I do that? Hmm. Situation. Got a blank. For me, that question has a negative connotation. So something that's possibly negative in my recent past. What would I have done differently? I'm pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding, knowing when to respond and knowing not to respond. So nothing really springs to mind that I wish I had done differently recently. In my past past, yes, but not recently. Oh, swallowing my pride, putting my tail between my legs, and saying I was wrong to friends. Sure. I contacted him again and we're fast friends again. you know this is again this is past past so not recent past so um probably altercations that I've had with my mom. You know, things I've said to hurt her. You know, when you hurt the ones that are closest to you, that sticks. Any one of those situations. I think my emotional IQ has grown. So I think in the past, past my emotional cue was very, was stuck on infant. So, so I have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families. My father never had a good relationship. Don't know if that will be possible. He's still alive, but he's in advanced Alzheimer's, so he's mad at everybody right now. Oh, it's fine. You know, it was slow. So. Someone? Oh. It's been a positive influence in my life. My sisters. I talk with my sisters. so extremely easy I sleep well each night anywhere from at least 8 to 10 hours a night oh lethargic just going through the motions you know it's like this. I'll frame it like this. David Lynch, who is not necessarily mainstream. He's done some crazy stuff as far as movies and TV is concerned. He said the idea of the angst driven artist is BS. He says, if you want to be creative, get a good night's sleep. I like that. Good. I can't wait to get up and start the day. Oh, if that happens, it's gradual. I'm always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive. In my life? With what? You mean, no, I don't think so. No, I haven't been diagnosed with any psychological acronym. No. This weekend, I had a good time with friends. We had a great time with friends, and we just were able to talk about some things. The conversation lasted two and a half hours, three hours. I didn't expect it to happen. It was good. I like talking with smart people, informed people, open-minded people. It was great. Those types of discussions are rare. It's almost like how you get after running or exercising, you know, the endorphins. It was the same thing. I am either with friends or working on my stuff, my writing. Or exercising. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? My height. I wish I were taller. I wish... Taller. Just physicality. I wish I didn't wear glasses. Nothing internal. I'm patient I've been commended for my patience by strangers my relationships with my friends and my family I understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and I take that time and energy Well, that's a really open general question, of course. And I'll go back. Are you talking recently? Are you talking in the past? I always regret. I regret. This is a little thing. It's not a big thing. not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day. It's a little thing. You know, so. I hate wasting time. I hate wasting money. I hate wasting energy. Hmm. That's a deep question. I'd say... I was codependent 10 or 20 years ago. I'd say get some help. Get some help. Your code... Okay. Sure. Bye. Bye. I just about hit the button. Cool. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/429_P/429_AUDIO.wav,0
430,48,2," Alright, there you are. It looks like we may have to... Oops. Scoop in a little bit. And we may have to have you scoop just a tad. Okay. Just a little bit. Okay. Okay. I think that should... I'm just gonna... Is it working somewhere? I'm not sure. Okay, great. I'll get that over here. Okay, so I will step out. When she says goodbye, press this button and I'll come back in. Got you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions before we start. And please feel free to talk to me. Your answers are very important. Are you okay with this? Yeah, sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm fine. Thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? Well, you can't beat the weather. And I just think the familiarity of home just makes me feel comfortable here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? smog, rudeness. Although it doesn't compare to New York. People can be unbearable and they're rude. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I'd like lately. I traveled more in the past, but not lately, no. What do you enjoy about traveling? i just think seeing different places it's um learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that pique my interest um let's see i think i spoke in new york i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's still only in america but i I just think being from L.A., I didn't think anything or any city could be bigger and more, how do you say, ostentatious than New York. But it was. It was quite an experience. And I didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown L.A. I think Times Square's got its beat. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Too many to mention. I don't even know where to start. Suppose it depends on the situation. I like to walk I like to play with my dogs reading anything where I suppose I could just sit still and let my mind go blank I know reading requires some concentration but you know just things that I don't have to exert myself too much. It helps me relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your hunger? In the past, I've had problems, but I'm getting better. I'll just say that. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? I probably argued with my roommate a couple days ago, but that happens. We're friends. It's a loving argument. if you will. How do you know them? I met this roommate about six, seven years ago. We just kind of moved around the same social circles and just got along. That's good. How do you like your living situation? It's cool. I mean, we do argue. We have our differences sometimes, but there's not one person I'd rather live with than her. She's cool. how much time do we have it's just too numerous to mention I wouldn't know how to answer that I think breaking up with a girlfriend that I truly cared about but knowing knowing that it just wasn't going to work that was very difficult What made you decide to do that? Are you happy to do that? So many. I don't have too many regrets, but things you erase from your memory? Oh, there's a lot. Too numerous to mention. I don't know how to answer that. The same girl? that I broke up with. She was a girlfriend of a best friend of mine. They were separated for several years, and we always had a chemistry, always a friendship, and it turned into something, which turned into a relationship, and it hurt him. Currently, we do not speak. My regret is I wish I would have handled that better. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Can you tell me about that? She's just strong, no nonsense. She's short, yet a firecracker, and I've always liked that about her. She always makes me feel comfortable. I'm like another son to her, in a way. That's great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I suppose it depends on my stress level. I have a lot on my mind. I have difficult sleeping and other times it just, if I really need to get to sleep it just requires me to listen to the radio, watching TV, reading, and eventually I'll get tired and fall asleep. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I suppose like anybody else. Tired, listless, you know, all the normal things I suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well. I feel good. No, not really. No, I wouldn't say I have. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes, I have. How long ago were you diagnosed? I was diagnosed probably about five years ago. What got you into the problem? I think I always knew there was a problem. I always knew there was some... I think I always knew before I got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and other things that are very hard to explain. I just was tired of feeling that way, so I sought help. What were your symptoms? I think just lethargy, no desire to do anything, motivation just wasn't there. I think normal depression-type things. I became socially awkward, which was a little bit different for me because growing up I was quite talkative. Do you still go to therapy now? I do. Do you feel like therapy is useful? I'm sorry, say again? Do you feel like therapy is helpful? Gotcha. It does. I think it does. What sort of changes have you noticed? Well, I think the number one thing, and this is what I'm amazed about, is the temper. I think it's allowed me to step back from certain situations and not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react. I think it's calmed me down for the most part. How hard is it? now it's becoming it's becoming routine initially it was very difficult when I was five years old oh no when you're a kid there's nothing really to there's nothing to be sad about. You're a kid. My best friend. A jerk. I have a dry sense of humor, so my best friend would probably... I think the banner back and forth is usually an insult, but you know, it's all in love. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be taller. I wish I could be more inclined to play basketball so I could then become, go to the NBA and be a millionaire. I know that's all unrealistic, but just answering honestly. Is there anything you regret? Hmm. Anything I regret? Have we asked this before? I mean, so many don't know where to start. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good one. Wow. Wow, I don't know. That's a good one. I'd have to think about that. I wouldn't want to answer that. That's a good one. usually are asked what you want you know how you feel 10 20 years from now looking back I don't know what advice I'd give myself something I really enjoyed I love there's several things I like to do. You know, I enjoy playing basketball. I love watching. I love watching all sports for that matter. What brings me real joy the past few years was become a hobby of mine is rescuing dogs, fostering dogs and finding them homes. Like I said, it's become quite a hobby of mine. And sometimes I find lost dogs and I'm able to find their owner and sometimes I'm not. So when I tell you what there's nothing to find the owner and i just found an owner last week for a small dog i found there was no greater feeling because the man told me the man told me how his um how his daughter was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give him back that was that was cool i think for somebody that uh didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating. That's something that I take pride in, though I don't show it or speak about it often. Yeah. You look like my friend Rachel. It's funny. I love those eyes, that hair. Were you guys watching me over there? Yes, you can see. Okay, that was fun. Yeah? Yeah. I'm glad you liked it. No, I swear that girl looks like a friend of mine. That's- Really?

When did you move to LA? Um, about two to three months ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back as yet. How does it compare to LA? Um, it's basically the same nice sunny weather. Why did you move to LA? For a career purpose, entertainment. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not very difficult because the people are very friendly. That's good. What are some things you really like about LA? Oh, definitely the weather. the upbeat environment and the opportunities for entertainment, correct. What are some things you don't really like about Hawaii? Earthquakes. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I travel a lot within the United States, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing new places and the different sceneries and meeting new people. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips. Oh, Utah. Utah. I just love the scenery in Utah. The rocks, the different sculptures of the rocks and the landscape was just fascinating. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I don't think I really have an outstanding one because I just enjoy seeing different scenery so I don't think there's any one particular one that stands out. What did you study at school? I just did two years of college and it was in social science. Are you still doing that? No. What's your dream job? My dream job is, well I assist in my husband entertainment, but my dream job is I guess guess one day to be a model but it's a bit I'm a bit too old for that now shy I guess I'm more of an introvert so I guess I'm more shy Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Oh, I listen to music. Like what? Inspirational music. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? I argued with my daughter. What was it about? Her just being disrespectful. How did you feel in that moment? I felt angry. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a great relationship. We get along well. We're quite close. We get along very well. That's great. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I can't think of any right now. Probably, um... staying away from my mother for a good many years. What made you decide to do that? Because of relationships problems that I had to adjust to with her. Are you happy you did that? Not really. Can you tell me about that? No, it's rather personal. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Sometimes I eat more sweets than I should, desserts than I should. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? A positive influence? My husband, my aunts, my daughters. Can you tell me about that? A positive influence? Well, in my husband's case, he believes in achieving, setting high goals, and you should be confident about yourself and think highly of yourself so he's he's um great in that area very easy grouchy How have you been feeling lately? Sometimes a little tired, but other than that, I'm okay. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt very happy. Um, very happy. I usually feel happy, but not very happy. Oh, I get very happy when I'm going to travel.

Oh, on the weekend I went to an activity, Heritage weekend, and the screening of a movie and I really enjoyed it on the weekend. That's great. How were your best friends around you? I don't know. Calm. Shy. I really don't know. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? My size. My weight. I guess whenever I'm called fat then I'm fat I think I'm patient I love people I love helping people. Yes. No, that's a bit personal. What advice would I give myself 10 years ago? Always aim for the best and be the best, do the best that you can every day. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Sometimes they get out of hand, sometimes disrespectful, but overall they're great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Yes, it's quite easy. Yeah, because of how from, how from my father, my husband, he's a disciplinarian, so it's a bit easy for me. What's the best thing about being a parent? The best thing about being a parent is to see a person that you gave birth to develop into a wholesome person and take the values that you taught them and kept the values that you taught them and continue to excel in their life. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing about being a parent is seeing your child sick or seeing them in a situation where you have no control and you can't do anything about it. It's very difficult then. You want to be able to be there in every situation or have control of every situation. in some things you just can't like sickness. Can you give me an example of that? Like I said, like if one of my children is sick, I feel I do the best that I can, but to see them in pain and I feel like I want to, I wish I was able to take that pain. Whenever they're going through anything, I wish I was able to take it instead of them. What are some ways that you're different as a parent from your parents? I think that me, I'm more sacrificial than my mom was to me. I think my demonstration of love is a bit more than she was to me. What are you most proud of in your life? But I'm most proud of. I'm proud of having a family, I guess, because it's something that I always wanted in life, to have a family. And I guess I'm most proud of that. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to.

432,18,1," All right. All right. Are you okay with this? I'm cool. Okay. So, are you in New York today? Fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? Yep. When did you leave for LA? About six months. Six months ago. How does it compare to LA? Why do you like flying? Photography job. Are you happy with your flight? It's a good move. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get used to the weather? I love the weather. What are some things you really like about LA? Cool people, relax, easy to talk to, nice environment. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Hmm. Crime when you go through some sections. I see what you mean. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I've done my share. What do you enjoy about traveling? The ability to capture events, be a part of exciting things like Olympics, games, festivals, special shows, meet new people. one hmm Canada it was nice very refreshing clean environment the people seem to be very light-hearted but you're able to do serious work I love the landscape I think was riding on board an Amtrak train. Nice. Yeah. How did you feel when you got on the plane? Liberated. That's great. What did you study at school? Photography. What's your new job? I think I'm doing it, you know. Why is that? I really believe I'm doing it. Not very difficult, you know, at least not for me because I think I have some natural inclination for it. And I connect well with people. That's good. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm shy but I'm forced to be outgoing because I, you know, you can't really get anything done being shy. given a choice I'd rather be you know a little more pull back until I you know I feel like just the coast is a safe path to go so that kind of curdles with my spirit of adventure sometimes I think Can you give me an example of that? An example? Hmm. Well, an example of what exactly? You mean, what aspect? Yeah. Okay. Well, an example like traveling. Sometimes you want to go to a particular place, and it's something great happening there. it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like Dick Vincent like Boston I used to go there a lot now you know everybody I talked to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there you know to do you know you know have a great time you know I think it's because all the disturbance that just happened kind of you know chose you off track of it make you rethink is that good getaway spot still right now something like that yeah i mean i i take walks i call up a friend we have tea or something you know I think I pretty much got that under control. What was the last time you had a lesson? There's probably something silly in a work situation that lasts about five minutes and we're pretty much having fun again. I don't really dwell on negative things too much. I don't have any regrets right now. I really can't think of anything right off the top. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was not hiring a good friend for a job that they weren't qualified for. That's hard. Can you tell me about that? Because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring, it's their competence. Yeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My father. Can you tell me about that? He just taught me how to overcome difficulties when I was growing up and how important it was to not give up and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away if you hold in there long enough. And I found that to be true. true. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's okay except for some of my distant siblings, you know, I don't see as often as I can. Why? Just, you know, when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people because they're not always there you know it's nothing like yeah um well you know i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so i tend to overlook the time sometimes but other than that you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it Well, I guess I'll be a little bit, trying to figure out how I'm going to get sleep, you know, as soon as I can to make up for it. But I try not to be grumpy or anything. I just probably feel a little bit tired. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I feel okay now. Have you ever studied music in the future? Whatever comes to mind. Well, I see a more hopeful future, you know, and I see a lot of new things unfolding, I mean, from that perspective, yes. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with PTSD? Never. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I feel okay now. I went to a great party last week. That was really cool. Well, it was like on a rooftop. uh it had a lot to really uh nice people who were basically in the same kind of a mindset pursuing the same type of uh goals and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information and a lot of good connections were made awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome why I did we can is cooking my own food relaxing you know and if I'm in the mood for company you know I have friends and you know family members join me well I kind of like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to the work I eat like crazy and nothing happened well you know I think people in general sometime miss misread you you know if you kind of like if you look different or you're in a different type of a different set of things make you excited or you're into a different way of thinking people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but um yeah I'm I've kind of figured it out and I'm pretty much over that you know so I see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me I've kind of worked those things out in time you know What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities are probably listening, I think, and maybe just talking, you know, on a conversational level. Is anything very bad? Yeah, sometimes people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that. But, you know, I guess that's probably one of the things that come with the turf. So when I see too much of that, I just pull back. What advice would you give yourself to a couple years ago? Go for your dream. Believe in what you're doing. Don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay. And that's the way I feel now that it's kind of evolved itself. What are you most proud of in the moment? most proud of I think my my kind of spiritual relationship you know my my my sadness about not being too too anxious about about things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen and you shouldn't really never allow yourself to be defeated I'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my my my thinking my framework that I think that saved me a lot of problems that could have been differently yeah okay i think i've asked everything any good questions bye hey Oh, I should have just done that.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/432_P/432_AUDIO.wav,0
433,36,1," Thank you. Okay. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are full of confidence. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in Linwood. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like all the sightseeing and all the clothing and stores that they have. Mm-hmm. What are some things you don't really like about the way? Well, some things, all the graffiti, basically all the wrongdoing, criminal activity, and all that bad stuff. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I've traveled in the past. I don't really go out of state. Why? Basically, money budget expenses doesn't limit me to go to another state. I understand. What did you study at school? I studied automotive technology and welding. What made you decide to do that? Just a passion for cars since I was little. Always basically just wanted to work on cars. How did you do that? Yeah, I really love working on cars. That's so good to hear. What's your dream job? My dream job would probably be to own my own automotive shop. Or to own a barbershop. or to just basically be probably a master welder. Consider myself a little more outgoing. Just because I like having fun, just having fun with my friends, being able to do anything I please. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I basically just smoke on my free time sometimes or just lay down, watch a movie, listen to some music. Like what? Basically hip-hop music or maybe a good comedy movie. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm fairly easy about it. I don't really let go, let my bad side get to my emotions. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Probably earlier today about with my girlfriend, her wife, basically about where we're going to go eat. How did you feel in that moment? I felt desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to go eat since she wouldn't make up her mind. Kind of made me uneasy. Probably just to relax and stay calm more than just to outburst and raise my voice. Can you give me an example of that? Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision would have to be to plan a family probably. Just basically making sure all the situations are where they're supposed to be and talking it out with my partner if we're really ready to begin a family. Just basically the love and bond between me and my wife. Basically it might be like a crash accident. Can you tell me about that? Wow, that sounds really hard. experience as far as just being in the car by myself not being able to control the vehicle at all and just hoping that I was gonna be okay it's fairly easy if as long as I've had a good dinner early on in my day fairly would go to sleep pretty good Just restless and just a little more stress, constant things more would be on my mind. Lack of energy, maybe. I'm feeling pretty relaxed, calm. Not really. same old me day to the day just try to stay happy and relaxed calm just try to stay positive energy no I have not been diagnosed no I have not been diagnosed by depression earlier today when I had some food. It's pretty close bonded. It was good. We talk about a lot of necessary stuff, try to help each other out at all times. My father, my sister, my mother. Well, my father's been there for as long as my mother has been, and they've both helped me as much as possible from school to clothing to taking me to my sister. She's basically graduated from college, so she's like a mentor to me, kind of look up to her as far as graduating school and everything, try to keep going. What do you mean to these kids? they're pretty fun they're outbursting minds basically just smarter kind of seem more advanced thinking compared to what the kids were probably thinking back in the in the old age they learn things a little more quicker um no not majorly just things that i could have thought i could have done better or or just a little differently like building my car differently getting traffic violations basically just kind of wish I wouldn't have sped through intersections or got another those tickets I've received on record. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I would basically just after you realize it the first time try not to do it again so the same mistake doesn't happen. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? persona kind of as far as whenever I'm angry just to find a way to be more easygoing maybe try to not be so much of a negative thinker at times when when things get a little harder Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Can you give me an example of that? when you clearly know that you have not done anything wrong. Probably earlier this year. Basically, a police officer pulled me over for thinking that I was a drunk driver, made me feel really, really dumb about myself, or try to accuse me of wrongdoing that I've been drinking and smoking when that was not the cause. I was just very tired that night. It was 12 a.m. Therefore, I looked probably a little sleepy. Just fun, cool, easygoing, good attitude, loyal. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Drifting, drifting my 240SX, spending quality time with my wife and kids. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? basically everything I've done for myself from when I graduated high school up to now thank you bye Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/433_P/433_AUDIO.wav,1
434,19,1," Okay. Yes, I am. I'm doing very good today. I'm originally from Chicago, Illinois. Moved out here when I was three. Yes. I never go back. Family issues. How does it compare to your life? It depends on what you're into. If you're into the fast life in Hollywood, it doesn't compare at all. If you're into the cold weather, then you would rather be out there. I like the sun. What's your favorite color? My mom and my dad split up. It's okay. I have no idea. I was only three when I moved out here. I like the sunshine. I like the weather. I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring, winter, fall, and the summer. I like the beaches. I like Hollywood. I like that the Lakers are here. And I love the people. It's a different variety. I think L.A. is a microcosm of the United States. People from all over the world come to the United States, and people from all over the country and all over the world, they come to LA for a better opportunity so that's what I like about LA. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, gang violence. Hi, I'm Missy. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. I've traveled one time to Arizona and one time to Stockton, California and another time to Barstow, California. but I don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances. I study alcohol and drug counseling. I just felt it in my heart that that's what I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions. So, that was kind of an easy choice. I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it. Just to see what it was. And I finished school and did an internship and got hired. And so, I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life. Are you still working right now? I'm not working right now. I actually moved away and I had to, I was married and we had to move away. We moved away because rent was cheaper. So I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move. But since I came back down, I've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so I can get back into counseling. Well, it can be very difficult at times because I have a felony. And so I can't work with the youth and I can't work with the elderly. and but the regular adults I can and then you have to be certified and I'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours so right now I'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um yeah they just want people to be certified um Not being certified, the experience, and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard. My dream job is to open my own facility. Or as an author. Do you consider yourself a child or a villain? You know, that depends on people mainly. I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I'm around. If people are perky, then I'm going to be perky. If they're standoffish, then I may seem shy, but I'm not shy. I'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up. But if people open up right away, then I open up right away. Okay. I mainly listen to music or I watch YouTube write poetry or just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I can sing which I can't So, that's, and another thing I do is I eat ice cream. Controlling my temper, I'm very, very good at it. It depends on what it is. I have to say that the last time I lost my temper was because I felt like somebody was scaring my mother. So I lost my temper. But 99 times out of 100, I don't lose my temper. I don't like to raise my voice. And I just like to be calm and cool. And I like everybody to be comfortable. I don't want anybody to be frightened or anything. There's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and, you know, taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it. I just believe that and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to heart problems and high blood pressure. So I definitely don't want that. Well, I was just telling you about, it was my mother's husband. And to tell you the truth, I could have handled that differently. But when I seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear, I just lost it. And I snapped. You know, I told my mother, like, I don't like this. You need to take care of this because I don't know how long I can keep my composure as far as this. because I've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother, mistreat my mother, but that's her husband. And so I kept my distance in their relationship. But when I saw her having fear in her eyes, that triggered a part of me that I don't like very much because I know if I get angry, I usually stay angry for a long time. So I should have just left. I should have just left and went home and rested and got up the next morning and went to church. But, yeah, we had a big-time explosion, and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months. So, yeah, those six to nine months, I can't get back. Yes. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, my brother's in prison. I haven't seen him in 20 years. He's been there 20 years. My sister moved to Chicago 13 years ago. I haven't seen her since then, so I'm only close to my mother. My son, I haven't seen him in five years, and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that's going to turn out for me. I just, you know, I have a small family and I have family in Chicago, but I don't mess around with that side of the family just because of what I've seen and heard. So I just don't want it to happen to me at all. So I just keep my distance. someone's been a positive influence in my life I would say taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and taught taught me how how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when I just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally um and of course um he's he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he's got 27 years clean and sober right now. He used to live on Skid Row and the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that I'll never forget. Feel guilty about my grandfather. Passed away in 2004 and at that time I was just getting out of prison um 2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer but I didn't get it because I had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that I considered to be more important than that plus the fact I didn't understand him what he was saying but But when he died, I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go. But I couldn't see it then. And I feel, I think about it all the time. Okay. Tell me about more or something that you wish you could have done. Something I can erase from my memory... Huh. What would be the day my brother hit my mom? I always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind. And it's like... That's one memory I can just go without replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again. So yeah, that memory right there. How did you feel about that moment? I felt conflicting feelings. Because on one hand, my brother was protecting me from getting beat. And on the other hand, he was hitting my mom. So, it's kind of in the middle. Most nights I don't, I go to sleep maybe 3 in the morning and I'm more than likely up at 7 in the morning. So I don't get much sleep. it depends it depends on the environment I'm in um if I don't sleep well I'm going eventually I'm going to be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if they're difficult people that's going to be a challenge for me and if people are easygoing no one will even know that I didn't get much sleep I've been feeling lately I just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me making some better decisions taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me so I'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen I'll send out a million resumes I don't care if I get five interviews I've never stopped because I know know that being a counselor is my life mission and and I'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and I have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before that the public is exposed to what I've been gathering. How do you understand your behavior and your behavior? I think I matured mentally and psychologically, and the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major, major breakthrough for me. So I know my thoughts have changed, and with my thoughts changing, my behavior has changed. I still have to monitor it. My thoughts and my behavior, I still have to monitor them. But overall, you know, back then I just tolerated myself. Now I actually like myself, and it will behoo you to feel the same way. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. No, I haven't. Have you been diagnosed with PTSD? No. last time I felt happy was last night because the Lakers won the basketball game yeah my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth because I always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and I always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i know human behavior when i see it and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people um have to come clean with me because when they look at me, they know that I see through them, like I said, like a clear glass with nothing in it. And, yes, that's why he calls me the truth. I wish I would have never, well, obviously I wish I would have never went to prison. I wish that I could change well my economic status my employment status and my teeth that's like a problem area for me I did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and I didn't take care of my teeth and now that I need to be confident about myself as I can be, you know, it always comes up every now and then, you know, the thought, like, I wonder if they're looking at my teeth, I wonder if they're looking at my teeth, I never get the, I never get the impression that they are, but in the back of my mind, there's these thoughts that says, are they looking at my teeth, so I will really change that, And I would change my physical size. I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier, but I'm working on it. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 20 years ago? 20 years ago, which would make me 18. At that time, I was a big-time high school basketball player for Fremont High School, and I had colleges coming to see me, and I would have given myself the opportunity was to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn't, and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils, and who knows? I could have been playing for the Lakers last night, but, hey. I'm most proud of the fact that you know what I'm most proud of my mom really really um she graduated from school she had a full-time job she had a full-time job um she would wake up at five in the morning go to work, get off her job at 3.30, go straight to the college, leave the college at 9 o'clock at night. She does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain. She was on the dean's list and the president's list. So doing all of this, you know, when they say that older people can't do things, I just think that dispels that rumor. And she recently got her license as an evangelist in the church. So I'm just real proud of that. And her life has been affecting people in a positive way. So, yeah, my mom. Okay, thank you. Goodbye. Okay. Okay. Oh, did you know that she stopped? Oh, I get a little flash. Oh, okay, okay. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/434_P/434_AUDIO.wav,1

How often do you go back to your hometown? About every 3-4 years. How does it compare to LA? It's similar. Why did you move to LA? My parents moved here. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. That's good. What are some things you really like about LA? The variety, the culture, the things, there's so many things to do. so many options traffic the pressure to live up to a high standard expensive sociology and psychology I got a job in the social service field and I didn't have an education and I felt that with an education I would be much better equipped to provide services for the population I was working with. Are you happy with that? Yes. Are you still working in that? What's your dream job? To own my own nonprofit organization that provides services for women that are considered marginalized populations. I like to travel but no I don't travel a lot What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about all your friends. you that one of my favorite places is Sedona, Arizona because it's so beautiful and it's so clean and open. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Neither. I can be really shy, but I force myself to be more outgoing, though I think people perceive me as very outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I go on Facebook, or I check my emails, or I watch movies. Sometimes I'm really good for the most part, but there are times when I'm feeling very stressed and I have temper outbursts, anger outbursts. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? I don't know. About, um, maybe, um, 30 days ago. and it was about my inadequate parenting skills. Ashamed, angry, confused. But I also felt like I needed to have my perspective understood. How about your kids? I have four kids. Three boys and one girl. My oldest son is living in Mar Vista and he's doing some menial job. He's creative and artistic and has a really good heart. My third son, my second son, because he's my third child, lives in Alabama. He has a daughter, and he also has a menial job. But he moved there to be with his daughter. He's not together with his daughter's mother. and he's funny and really smart and wickedly clever. And my third son, my youngest, is living in Los Angeles, is living on his own, working at a menial job, is kind of finding himself. He's extremely kind and sensitive and caring and loving. But he tends to be pretty hard on himself and has a lot of opinions about a lot of things. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I love being a parent, but being a parent isn't easy. What's the best thing about being a parent? What's the hardest thing about being a parent? What are some ways that you're doing this in your parents? I think I tell my children that I love them and that I'm proud of them and that I have a much more open communication and I'm more accepting of the choices that they make even though I might not agree with them. How close are you to your family? I'm close to my sisters. I'm pretty distant from my mother. I was close when I was younger to my father, but he passed away when I was 25. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? My college professors. Can you tell me about that? I think that they helped me perceive a different perspective on human beings, made me more altruistic and more open and less judgmental. What's something you feel guilty about? poor and unsuccessful. I think I could have made better choices regarding the fathers of my children and or stepfathers. When I left my kids. Can you tell me about that? My first marriage, I was really immature and unknowledgeable and felt that I couldn't provide for my children so I made a choice to leave them with their father for a period of time. And that was a regret. And then when I was 36, I was diagnosed with cancer and I had to make the choice of again leaving my kids with their prospective fathers. And, um, until I got better I wasn't able to be a full-time mother. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it was. Separation from my kids is really hard. Separation from my kids is really hard. I feel ashamed and guilt and remorse Why? Because had I had a more stable financial and emotional and psychological foundation, I might have had the ability to not have caused them some of the problems that they have today. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Sometimes good. I have to be really tired. Sometimes not so good. What do you like when you don't sleep well? Ineffective. Ineffective. I think I'm making more of a conscientious effort to get organized and take some steps to physical health, well-being, getting out more, forcing myself to participate in life more. No. Yes. Originally I think I was diagnosed in 1980. Maybe before that, but it was never a formal diagnosis. What got you to sleep well? I tried to commit suicide. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Sometimes. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? I am no longer truly suicidal. Hmm. I don't know. 2006, 2007?

I am open to learning. I crave learning. I'm socially empathetic. I love my children. I'm a good friend. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well my depression is one thing. I wish I was more intelligent, that school was easier for me. I wish I didn't have such low self-esteem. I wish I could be more motivated in participating in areas that I'm interested in. Yeah. Go to college. My children. Goodbye. Thank you.

Where are you from originally? Mexico. Really? When did you move to LA? When I was young, seven years old. How often do you go back to your hometown? I've been there like three or four times for vacation. How does it compare to LA? Well, it's less stressful.

I want to have my own business, either making web pages, just be able to be free, and don't be relying on someone else. Just be able to have freedom for myself. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Why? I just like to, you know, be around people, like to get to know people, and depending on the person and how I feel around them. Okay. I like to hear music or you know to do different things like play sports or two different things just to unwind. Well, I'm getting better at it, you know. Well, it was like two days ago, it was something about I needed to pay a bill or something that I had taken care of, but the person, he's like more picky about it. You know how girls are. They want everything right there and then. I have a handle, you know, I have everything there and they're just bugging. Sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to resolve something. I felt like I was overwhelmed. I already had it resolved. I just was waiting for a check. You know, it's not on my control, but I already had made the proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it. And it's like, you're making, you know, an argument, you know, a storm in a glass of water. It's like, mm-hmm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. What's something you feel guilty about? Not really. Not that I can think right off the top of my head. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision? That was just not on top of my head right now. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Well, the only things that I remember is when I black out or different things like that that I don't remember. But nothing like a particular, only when my brothers died and different things like that. Can you tell me about that? Well, my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble. And it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much, get into it. I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me about your relationship with your family. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? done correctly, not trying to take the easy way out. It's a little hard because, especially here in Los Angeles, there's a lot of different things that you can get into that's not that positive, and it's hard to stay focused on, you know, the correct stuff. Well, normally I just knock out. It's not that hard. It takes me like half an hour or 15 minutes. Sometimes I can't even wake up even with the alarm. They have to wake me up. My girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on. I just knock out. What are you like when you're desperate? I do get a little either angry or I don't feel good and I don't feel good energy. But I still have to know. I know I have to do something, so I still go through with it. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling good. I've been a little restless, but not that much. I had to do stuff, so I just put myself to do it, no matter how I feel. Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, nothing out of the ordinary. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.

Mm-hmm. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax but nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home but without getting any calls or no interruptions you know just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just be with her doing other different things. How are your best friends? Like an outgoing guy, you know, very social, but at the same time I'm reserved depending how I feel with people. I have to, you know, build trust or feel comfortable with them. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I'm changing a lot, you know, like my temper and different things, drinking things. I'm changing a lot of different things so I can get more different things done. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. logo they know it was American, but they thought it was like, you know, it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place and you have the money, you ask for something, you're going to ask for something because you have it, not just to wait until their time, just because they saw a logo of a card, that's how they, you know, it just, it was ridiculous for me. I understand. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Basically to stay more focused on different things, stay in school and you know don't go you know try to control my temper and do different things because if I knew what I know now back then it'd be different. Well I did drop out but I did go back to school and you know I did get my high school and right now I'm in the process of doing other different things so right now I was getting my high school, getting that together. And right now I'm working to another goal. I'm trying to get, you know, either going back to school. So it's basically getting back to school and finishing the high school, the GED. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay, you're welcome. Goodbye. Bye.

So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity of the city, all the attractions and things that you can see, the food, restaurants, things like that. What are some things you don't really like about the way? I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Well, what do you enjoy about traveling? from LA. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, let's see. Last trip I made was up to the Central Coast, up in Cambria and Pismo Beach area and Sol Vang Sandi Niz. Nice. Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? when I got to study abroad in Madrid, Spain when I was a student at UCLA. In terms of travel? Yeah, I participated in the education abroad program at UCLA where you go live in another country to learn the language and you live there for a year and you study at the university. and it was just a memorable year, an experience that I would never forget. That's so good to hear. Thanks. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Probably more shy, but sometimes I could be outgoing. Like what? I'm more shy in terms of, you know, it takes time for me to get to know people. I mean, I'm not a real party person. I don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that. But if I'm among friends and things like that, then I can be pretty outgoing with people I know. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Um, drink wine. Um, yeah, drink wine, maybe listen to some, uh, nice music. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. I can, I'm pretty good at controlling my emotions. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Oh, gosh. I wouldn't say it was a real argument. It was more like a, what, just a discussion, maybe, about finances, maybe. Money. How did you feel at that moment? Oh, just a little irritated, but not really. Not really strong emotional. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Oh, wow, gosh, I can't think of anything at the moment, so let's skip that one. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Um, maybe eating more junk food than I admit to. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I ever had to make? Uh, maybe buying a home or remodeling the home. spending money for it. I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so I could be self-sufficient and independent. Yes, very happy. Erase from memory? Why? when I was student teaching and discovered that teaching K-12 was not for me. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied, my major was Spanish and linguistics. What made you decide to do that? I was very good at foreign languages and I thought I enjoyed taking them and I was just having a good time taking foreign language and I was getting good grades so I thought maybe this is what I should go into, foreign languages. Are you still working in that? I was an adult ed teacher teaching English as a second language for 30 years and I just recently decided to retire myself. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a pretty good relationship with my family, with my mother and my sisters. My father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members. Yeah, but on the whole, we have a pretty good relation with the rest of my family now. Pretty easy. I don't have any problems. What are you like when you don't sleep well? How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good I think. I've been feeling pretty good. No major health problems or anything. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I was really happy? Probably when spring break came around and it was vacation time and it was time to go on our trip. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, it was a week trip up to the central coast to Cambria and Pismo Beach and Santa Ynez. It was just a nice getaway, relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden, drinking wine and enjoying different sights and eating good food and buying wine to replenish our dwindling supply at home. great thanks how would your best friend describe you? uh... i think she would describe me as uh... kind and sweet and motivated and uh... just a nice person what are some things you wish you could change about yourself? uh... let's see sometimes i wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing, I guess. I tend to be more reserved, so I wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. Ah, really badly about myself. Ah, let's see. Probably when I betrayed a confident with some friends of mine when I taped them singing Christmas carols and I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that. Oh no. Yeah, but it all got resolved at the end. We were all, it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part, but it worked out okay. Okay. So anything very bad? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? never give up but see it as a disappointment if it doesn't work out. I'm a good listener. I'm a motivated person. I'm hard-working. I'm conscientious and caring I'm generally a pretty happy type person something recently what I really enjoyed going to the going to the festival of books at USC this weekend yeah the festival of books is a it's a festival where they have all these book book authors and they have them food demonstrations and seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and there's a lots of food and and a lot of authors signing books and things it's a great event for her just to get out and and it was nice weather too so it's nice to be out there mm-hmm yeah I really enjoyed that especially the food Thanks. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of? Most proud of? Probably being successful in my work, in my life, in my marriage, and just basically being happy with myself. Okay.

Okay, so you can go ahead and take the headset off, and I'm going to stop the recording. Okay. Interesting.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/437_P/437_AUDIO.wav,0
438,27,1," . Okay. So once again, when she says goodbye, press this button. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. Where are you from originally? I was born and raised right here in Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? The weather would be number one. I also like the diverse cultures. I like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do. And there's a lot of opportunity here, not just for myself, but for my kids. And I think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career, go to school, learn about different people. What are some things you don't really like about the way? The traffic, the cost of living. Sometimes I think it's too big. And I think the transportation system, as far as the bus and trains, is long overdue. They need to revamp it or add more buses and things like that. Just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation. I travel when I can a little bit here and there. I have not been overseas yet, which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years. So I've just traveled domestically. I try to take at least one trip a year somewhere. What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about all your trips. I went to go visit a friend and I stayed about I think three to four days and I got to see the Capitol. He showed me around, showed me all the historic landmarks and sites, the White House, the Capitol building. I got to see a lot of other different government buildings. It was a good experience. The irony was I had to fly on 9-11 and so that had me a little uneasy. But once I was in the plane up in the air I was okay and it was all good. Once I was back home I was like yes! But I missed the trip and I look forward to going back. nice what's one of your most memorable experiences um attending my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in Hawaii um actually Maui that was actually two three years ago in August and I've been trying to get back ever since and I want to take my kids I just love it there I actually kind of look forward to moving there one day How many are your twins? Typical boys, active, all over the place, hormones, puberty. It's actually an interesting time because the two older boys are going through puberty. Their teenage years. My youngest is still trying to figure some things out for himself. Doing that transition stage of 8 to 9 years old. He'll be 9 in June and my oldest will be 14. It's a challenging time for me as well. What's the best thing about being a parent? to a teenager and then it's a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and it's just it's very rewarding and then I'm actually I look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college because i really love children and giving back that's so good to hear what's the hardest thing about being a parent um there's probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is the financial. Well, I would say that along with some of the emotional, with them having to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child rearing. You know, just the everyday things that you have to deal with. Sometimes when you're just tired, you don't want to be bothered, or you're trying to do things for yourself, you have to be reminded that, okay, I got to cook or I have to go pick my son up or I have to take him to baseball practice. This one wants to go over here. This one is acting moody and, you know, just those types of challenges as well as the financial and, you know, making sure, you know, you're able to put food on the table, you're paying your rent and, you know, you're keeping up with the day-to-day. And that's, those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with. How do you help with that? right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably. What did you study at school? I studied communications actually. I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying business. What made you decide to do that? I just thought that there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs. Then I have a desire to go to graduate school. I just figured in the long run it would put me in a better position and give me more opportunities. with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of tv reporting and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought I would go into something more realistic and you know but I like both fields I really do I like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and so we'll see What's your dream job? you know the the people there and um being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes um it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i would like to do that Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? situation, then I'm like, okay, you know, I warm up to the, to the situation or the people, but I'm also friendly. I can be very friendly and outgoing. I like to talk. Um, you know, I seem like a chatterbox, but I'm not really. So usually if I'm in a big space with a whole lot of people, I don't like to be the center of attention. I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i overall i am an open friendly person For me, it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything, all electronics, and just sitting for a few moments, meditating, praying, or reading a good spiritual scripture. If I'm able to, I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know, things that will, I kind of like the physical part of it, I like massages, things that really release tension. And if not, then just, like I said, just sitting at home reading and praying. Or I like the beach. I love the beach. So sometimes I drive and go sit by the beach. I also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself. Or get a mani-pedi or maybe go window shopping. You know, things like that. Okay. How are you controlling your time? pretty good sometimes i'm just like i don't really have so much an issue with the temper as i am i just i'm more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable um quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me I just lose patience um outside of that I'm actually pretty good I try to be very you know conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if they're a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be I do try to be patient and understanding because I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to extend that to me um you know when my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too it's that time of the month i'm just like uh just leave me alone um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human in their times or i have my days or moments when i could just like go off and just lose it. Well, I haven't really had, not per se an argument, but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express. so I would say because it was not a personal contact but a company I we it really was an argument but you know I had some um issues with American Express I had to call in about on I think Saturday and I kept um I wasn't getting the response I expected and so I would the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rep was trying to over talk me then I was trying to over talk her so you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know I just kind of like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was um a tense exchange for a minute or two Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Probably the most recent contact, and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express. Or actually it was on Sunday. Yeah, and I know the person was trying to help me, but, you know, when you're constantly being told different things, and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation, and it not be resolved, it just takes you there so um just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't have um and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i definitely wish i could have kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite well I probably have had a couple but probably demos is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and um I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of I want to say really pushed me into having terminating the pregnancy and that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that baby or what could have been I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but I know deep down inside secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward So that would have been probably the hardest, especially emotionally. I could deal with a lot, and I have dealt with a lot. You know, being unemployed or, you know, a lot of financial problems. But that, to me, was the hardest. Thank you. No. No. Um, okay, you know, um, I was laid off in December, so I've been constantly trying to do things to, you know, get back on my feet. So that's been a little tough. I've had to face a lot of challenges in dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school. so I've my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her master's in social work so I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year, but more so recently, although I'm very, very happy for her, you know, and she's a good person, and she deserves it, but, you know, of course, she's down inside it when she was me, so that, too, has kind of been bothering me. Well, I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to talk. I'm really good with children. That's why I would like to teach or be a counselor. Although I have not really tapped into it, I know I'm a very creative person. I know I write pretty good. I could possibly be a creative writer, but I know I'm very creative. So if given the opportunity, I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills. Something like with maybe songwriting, fiction writing, probably like interior decorating, anything artistic, just anything because I love music, I love the arts, I love drama, I love plays. I'm not a big fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so I think those are my strong points as well as just getting along with people I know I'll make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time I have a good ear for listening I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot and one of my friends call me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from sc but um i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had very traditional southern parents um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign I'm a Pisces but um I'm really good with people just you know period you know like I said I have my moments but I know that if it's something I could go into and develop I would do well not really some of the situations um I wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children, um, picked a different partner, um, and I say that, I mean, my son's father is great, but, um, a great father for my kids, but not so much as a partner for me, we're not together, we haven't been together in years, but I'm just saying, overall, I think, um, had I, yeah, I think I would say, if I could, let me backtrack that, say, not finishing school when I should have and not following my dreams and goals and doing things as I kind of was planning initially and I think that would honestly be the one thing I could say I regret is not following my goals and finishing school on time and pursuing what I really wanted to do. What advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago? Stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm pretty stable and consistent, just with overall, I think, how I face adversity, how I face things, you know. I am a pretty committed person. I try to, you know, if I say I'm going to do something, I try to stick to it. I'm a very loyal friend. uh... and uh... product that uh... maintain that a pretty good job with raising my kids great thank you i'd Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/438_P/438_AUDIO.wav,1
439,20,1," Oh gosh, fix the hair up there. Now I can really see. Okay, alright. Okay, you're welcome. Yes. I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from and which one are you from? I'm from Los Angeles and born in Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? You have a lot of places to go, a lot of people to see, a lot of things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Smog. The environment has changed over the years. I've been around since 1952 and I was born here in Los Angeles and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog. And basically that's about it. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I've been to several places in the United States, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? Trying different types of cuisines. I like to go to museums, like the historical. I'm a historical buff. Just going somewhere different than where I've been here all my life. What do you do about your trips? Let me start with, well, try Boston. I had never been to Boston before, and when I went, I was able to look at the historical of the buildings. And I went to, I saw the Lake Charles and the boats and stuff. It was just, it was a good experience. There's another place I went to. I took a ferry, and my mind went on blank on it. God, I can't even think of it right now. But other than that, New Orleans, I've been to New Orleans. I didn't go to the Mardi Gras. I don't like to go to Mardi Gras when they have a lot of people. I just went on an off-season. I enjoyed that. And I've been to Atlanta, Georgia. And I have taken a cruise. I went to the Caribbean. I took a Mexico cruise. My next cruise I'd like to go to is Alaska. because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental. That's great. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm outgoing as far as going places. I don't have a problem eating alone. I don't have a problem meeting people. I'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I have a favorite thing. I like to go on the Internet and I like to do sweet states. I'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests, and I've been very successful since I was a kid. I've won a lot of sweet steaks. And in the evening time, I find like an hour of time, and I just go online. I'm so good at it, I know just about exactly the right time to even enter. I usually try to enter them before midnight when everybody else is asleep. So it's been successful for me. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Getting married and having my children. Tell me about your case. I have a 27-year-old son and I have a 31-year-old son. Both of them, well, one of them is married, the other one is not. And I just not too long ago became a grandmother, so I have one grandson. son and my son he works for the county of Los Angeles as a property conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer. So and I've been married for 33 years and basically my marriage is pretty strong. you know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to them and find out what's going on and tell them that you love them my son I've taught them all the time when they went out the door I love you and even today when they'll call me and hang up they said mom I love you you always have to give them that that good feeling when they leave the door that you care and I've never had to go to any jail to get them out they've been pretty obedient I mean boys will be boys but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble and I'm very proud of that especially the boys I don't know how it would been with girls and they've been a little different but boys I have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and I watched my son like I said just a recent grandmother and I watch him how he handles his son. And it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son, to be responsible, to go to work every day, and he knows that, hey, I got a wife, I have a son, and it's my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads. So it pays off. And basically he treats her well. My mother was more stricter on me. My parents, for some unknown reason, I guess because my sister and I, we're the girls, they weren't stricter on the boys, but they were more stricter on the girls. So they didn't let us go to a lot of places. And then my parents also, they weren't the type that liked to travel. And I used to look at them and say, no, I'm not going to be like them. I'm going to travel. I'm not going to just stay home. I mean, there's nothing wrong with them because they found love at home and did things at home, but they never really traveled anywhere. My mom, she was afraid of planes, for one, and I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere. And she said, oh, I'm going to go here, I'm going to go there, but she never did. She died. She never did do any travel. So I made up for her. And I want to do something different and that's to travel more than and be more out there. I was more of a social butterfly. My mother was not a social butterfly. So I made up for it. How long did it take you to become a woman? I think before I speak. And then I am the type of person also to, I take on other people's feelings before I blurt out the wrong thing. I try to analyze the situation first because sometimes you can open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you will not be able to get out of. When was the last time you argued with someone? It's probably something about my husband did. Oh, I know what it was. It's about, well, probably it was some new construction that my husband is working on on our house. We had a disagreement on that. Men have their own way of doing things, and I had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house. But because of the personal relationship he has with this person, he went on ahead. And now he sees all the downfalls, and he didn't listen. And so I didn't say I told you so, but I guess he could tell by my facial expression that he'd have done wrong. And I told him, I said, look, you're losing money. And it became one problem after another. So now our little construction thing is up in the air right now because he knows he has done wrong. But he doesn't want to face the fact that, well, he knows it, but he doesn't want to really face the fact. So he says, look, it's my project. No, it's our project. So that's one of the biggest arguments that we're having right now that I can think of that's recent. And I felt that he didn't really listen to me, and he more so looked at a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways because I told him that you need to do your research. I'm the type of person, I do my research before I jump into something. I try to dot my I's and cross my T's, but my husband, he's not like that. He's like, oh, I can get this person to do this project for X amount of money. and he's a good friend of mine so I don't care I mean is he licensed he doesn't look at all that stuff he just jumps into it which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and I mean it was a lot of money and so I was really very upset yesterday and I was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could have saved because we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn't make any sense. I retired early. I was very fortunate to retire at age 50. I retired in 2002. I was working 2002. I was working for the state of California as a disability analyst. And what happened was I was able to, the reason why I was able to retire so early because I had been working since I was 18 and I had like 31 and a half years of service. And what was so nice about it that I only needed to invest in like 10 years in my health insurance. So I was able to get full health insurance. But the only thing about it when you retire, I was with CalPERS and I don't know if you're familiar with CalPERS but we have an excellent retirement system and since I had been working with them so long I didn't get the full percentage I should have stayed till I was 55 but I got out at 50 and I didn't get the full amount but that's okay I found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason and then I have one-itis. So I think that was the kind of mistake I did. I should have kind of waited until I was 55 and 50. But I look at it now as far as the health insurance, I really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up. And I don't, I pay very little money. So I think that over negates the money that I receive. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see the hardest. It's probably when my mom died because I'm not used to anybody dying. My mother died in 99 of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and putting her funeral together. my brother and sister, we were never faced with anybody dying or putting a funeral together. And all the responsibility, because I am the eldest, it was put on me. And I'm like, oh, my God, what do I do? And so I was kind of like left out there trying to find her insurance policy because I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order, and she never got to it. So the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things. I myself, I keep my things organized, but for some unknown reason, she didn't have hers organized. I think that was the hardest, and knowing how much I had to pay because I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. And unfortunately, my mom, this is interesting, she had one little small barrel insurance, but she had a million dollars of accident insurance, and she didn't die of course with an accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything yeah it was it was but now i can handle that i um this will sound weird but um since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and I, we got together, and we wanted to get our insurance policy, not insurance policy, but what do you call it, the barrel insurance. We had that, and we've had it for many, many years. So it's almost paid, but it's 10 years. It'll pay for everything, the plot and everything. And another thing that I did, I even written my own obituary. I know that sounds weird. So my son make one phone call, that's it. I don't want them to go through what I went through. And my husband agreed. That's the one thing we did agree on. And he said he don't want anybody to have any problem. People coming in and telling them what to do. It's already written. We did a living trust. I mean, it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. And that's it. I have no problem sleeping. I sleep very well. Pretty good. How do you feel about your health? I've been a little tired, but that's only because of physical condition. I found out I have vitamin B deficiency and vitamin D deficiency. So it's more physical, but not mental. How do you help with that? Um, exercise, walk, walking more so. No, not really. No. No. I'm basically happy all the time. I'm more so I'm making other people happy. I get more phone calls of people who want inspiration about things when they have projects they're working on, and I try to encourage them. And it makes me feel good when they hang up and say, you know, hey, I really appreciate your input. Thanks. And then I'll follow up on them and see how they're doing. That's so good to hear. How do your best friends help you? Oh, resource person. I've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because I'm the type of person, I research everything I get into just about. I just don't dive into any situation. I try to look up information. I know we have the technology here that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never going to give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a a whole lot of stuff that even though technology you have it right at your finger but you can find things and then they say I'm more of a resource person most people come to me just the look of things and I get that that spunk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it I'd like this to be satisfaction I wish I can stop going up and down on my weight I'll lose weight I'll go on this big diet before the summer time and then by Christmas time I have what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if I can stop binging and making food my friend I think that's just a nervous disorder I like to eat And, but also I don't like to be overweight either because I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them on right now. So I know myself, I'm going to go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so I can get in those nice clothes. So it's mostly not happy with my weight. And that's it, yeah. I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. Is that anything you regret? No, not really. I regret that I can't stay skinny. I can't lose, I mean, I can lose the weight, but I regret not being able to keep it and fall back on putting the weight back on. What advice would you give yourself 10, 15 years ago? Let's see, what I got by 10 or 20 years ago. I would have saved a little bit more money before I retired. And I'm basically putting away more money before I retire. retiring too early. What's proudest of my life? Meeting a lot of people that came in my life. I got good friends. I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school and very rare you can find anybody can walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends. We were in the sorority together, went to college together, lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just We just had, all of us had our 60th birthday, and our high school group, we put together a 60-year birthday reunion. And here all 15 of us, with the exception of one, we're all alive and healthy, and we keep in contact. So I think it's basically keeping the same friends. I think we're going to probably outlive each other. Okay. I think I've asked everything I can. Okay. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. That's kind of weird.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/439_P/439_AUDIO.wav,0
440,61,2," And it's always female. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm really learning about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions when I start. And please feel free to send me a call. Your answers are very important. Are you okay with that? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay, thank you. I was born in East Los Angeles. Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? in the same day i think probably the overcrowding and small Not frequently, but I have. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures. What's a good one? Sure, the last trip I've taken outside of here was to Italy. And that was my second time being there. And I enjoyed it more this time. because I knew what I wanted to see when I came back, and I was better prepared for Italians and their culture. I felt I was just better prepared, I thought, for that trip. What's one of your most memorable experiences? That would be being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent. Wow. What did you study at school? Human development. I actually didn't decide at first to do that. I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant. And through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and I miss I had a family so I had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered human development as a major and I just went right in and used my you use my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major and I'm happy with it. That's good. Are you still working on it? Currently, no. I stay at home. I have a little one. Well, he's not so little. I'm preparing to go back to work. In the meantime, I design jewelry. Nice. Tell me about your kids. Well, I have three children. I have almost four-year-old and then I have two older children, 17 and 23. Do you find it easier with your parents? No. What's the best thing about being a parent? That your children, the love from them and for them is unconditional. all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so I think I'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy and I think that my parents, the time that my parents were parents it was just kind of like, you know, is she fed, is she dressed she has a house, I mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so there wasn't too much I felt that parents thought about in terms of parenting in that way. Like today, there's books for every age, every year, month. So I think it differs in that way tremendously. Very close. Outgoing. I don't feel uninhibited. I feel confident to talk to people. I probably talk more than I need to. I bead. I design jewelry. That's what I do to relax. That's great. How are you at controlling your temper? it's going to come out and yeah that that's something they have to work on like exercising or something it was my husband and it was about he asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him. Really tired of talking about that same topic. um well it came it spawned from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that I've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating and um I we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh I mean not just that but I don't know, just about cheating in general. And so I just said what I normally say is that I haven't cheated and that I did think about that when we were first together. But it was just a mere thought. And then his response was, I know that if we cheated on each other, we would never tell one another. And that just kind of, I guess, irritated me. I was really bothered by that. And I just started thinking, you know, we're having this conversation yet again. And why are we having this conversation? Are you the one that's cheating? And so that's how that, that went into that argument. I mean, It was yelling. I mean, it was part conversation and part texting. That sounds really hard. How do you talk with them? I'm not talking at all. Pretty much any situation that involves my children and if I've yelled because I really don't like And if I came to the point where I've had more of yelled, it bothers me because I was yelled at a lot. And I just feel bad about that. And I try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children, no matter how upset I might get. And the result in yelling. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. That would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not. about that? Yeah. Yeah. I, um, I was just talking about it yesterday actually. And, um, I was pregnant and I had wanted, I wasn't married yet and I had wanted to be married. but I just didn't think that it was the right time for me. And I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy but I made the decision by myself. And when my partner discovered that I was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me. And so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not. And... Oops. And... Hopefully this is on correctly. Hang on. This earpiece is falling off. There we go. That was probably the hardest decision. Actually, you know what? No. I wouldn't say that's the hardest decision I ever had to make. I'm sorry. The hardest decision that I had to make in my life was whether or not the hospital should unplug the life support machine for my father or not. That was the hardest decision. What made you decide to do that? because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been, to resort to the situation that he was in, not capable of doing anything at all, either speaking for himself, was beyond who he was and I just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable, I was told. So I agreed to resort that. Not. Hardly ever. Too many things running in my mind. and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends. Even though I know that they're going to come, I mean, I'm constantly worried about how they are, when they come home, and so you really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time. but sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep. I'm just exhausted. I pass out. But it's hard. Very stressed. Can you tell me about that? My son is, has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and it's been really hard. Have you ever studied music in a video or a talk show? Yes, I've been probably very short, moody, irritable. Well, I often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening. My mind just goes from point A to point B, and I don't even know how I got there. You know, it's interesting. yeah no yes about three years ago my OBG suggested I see a psychiatrist. Yes. Well, I'm in the process of changing therapists, so it's been about because the program that I was in lost funding and I lost my therapist or the therapist that I was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and um but I did notice when I was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope um when I picked up my son from um when he was released from um jail How do your best friends grab you? I go get her. Probably, you know, she would use the term hustler, but meaning that I'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family. I mean, you know, legally, of course. Outgoing, maybe sometimes a little too outgoing for her. And compassionate, sensitive, loyal. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? All the things that remind me of my mother. Well, yelling, the yelling part was one. Just the little things that used to drive me so crazy. I can see myself doing them, and it bothers me a lot. Regarding what? Not too much, really. I don't know. What advice would you give yourself to go to college right after high school and not wait? and that I didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life. I visited my son yesterday, and that was really good. Yeah. How did you feel about him? I was happy that he was safe. What are you most proud of in life? My children. and my accomplishments in school and work. Bye. Partway this tilted back. The light came off. I was hoping it did not get out everything it needed. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/440_P/440_AUDIO.wav,2
441,72,2," All right. Okay, now she can ask you some questions and then when she's done she'll say goodbye. After she says goodbye, you press this button to let me know you're done. Hi, I'm Ali. I'm a student at New South Wales. I'm a student with lots of people and I'm very interested in learning more. I'm not a therapist, but I'm very worried about people and you're not worried about me. I'll ask you a few questions, but I'll start. Are you feeling good for the company? The answers are really simple. Are you a teenager? Yes. Okay. So, are you a teenager? I'm doing fine, thank you. Okay. Where are you from and where are you from? Los Angeles, California. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? The variety of people. The multicultural food. And going to movies. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Rude people. Scary people. It's violent. I'm sure you can tell by these shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yes. What have you been doing while traveling? Experiencing different things. Seeing different cultures. And what did you do while on the ship? Well, I was stationed in Germany for three years. It was a great experience. The food was great, the Bavarian Alps, the snow, the people. I loved it. Having a baby. Well, it was just the most memorable thing in my life, something I'll never forget. How about your parents? One son. Grown. Handsome. Father of two. Is your father angry with your parents? No. It's actually very hard for me. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Not becoming angry too quickly. What's the best thing about being a parent? Being able to cultivate a mind and love someone unconditionally. What are some moments that really make a difference in your life? Well, I went through a lot of trauma as a child, so as a parent I was very afraid for my child to go through that same trauma. to protect him from it. I think it's really hard because you never really know people and what they'll do. Outgoing. Because if I'm in a room with people, I'm usually the first one to start talking. As a matter of fact, I have fish. Aquarium. That's what keeps me calm. Not very good. When was the last time you argued with somebody? It seems like every day I argue with somebody about something, but yesterday. Can you tell me about that? A lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and I politely told her I was in line and she didn't want to move. Has that happened in your life? Yes, it has. Because sometimes if people don't want to move, then I feel it's my place to move them. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hurting people, physically. Can you give me an example of that? If I feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me, I can get very ugly. I don't like that about me. Tell me about a situation that you received a hand in differently. I was pulled over by the police, and they had someone with my name, and they were very rude to me and I really wasn't happy with the way they treated me. I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. How to stay calm when someone has crossed over into my boundary, my personal space. Can you tell me about that? I can't let people get too close to me. If they do, I lash out. I don't want anybody in my area of protection, I guess. How do you comfort them? Stay away from people. Stay away from them. It's hard. You can't live in this world without other people. Sometimes they just irritate the heck out of me. Tell me about your life. Or something that you wish you could have done. Being assaulted in the military is something I wish I could forget. Can you tell me about that? Just that I felt helpless, alone, ashamed, and angry. That's about all I want to go into it. Okay. How old were you when you were 18? You were very young, weren't you? Yeah, very young. Did you have a second death? No. How did you get into the military? Because I was assaulted and I have a fear of people in uniform, like policemen hurting me or other military veterans hurting me when they explode or go off or have issues of PTSD. I worked for the federal government. Well, it just seemed like a normal progression. government gives you ten points preference over other people for being in the military, so it seemed like a natural choice. An organization that had a book of rules and they followed them, the government, one government to another. Are you happy with it? Yes. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian? Well, it was hard in the sense that in the military you're given, you're told to handle handle it. And in the civilian world, you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done. Yeah. What did you study at school? Administration of Justice. Are you still working in that? No, I don't work anymore. Okay. Have you ever been done with administration? Oh, yeah. How long ago were you diagnosed? Almost two years. What brought you to the hospital? The feeling that I was always going to be hurt, that someone was out to get me. I had nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety attacks, outbursts of anger. I was always in emotional pain and I always wanted to hit somebody. Yes, mostly disrespect. What I feel is disrespect are people getting too close to me or I feel in fear of them for some reason. I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep. What? Irritable, angry, moody, pissed off. Irrational. Tired. Sick of the world. Angry at the world. Wanting to be left alone. Sometimes I don't want to go on. Yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been in prison? Well, I can recognize a trigger now when something is going to trigger me. I can at least know and act accordingly if I want to. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. When I saw my grandchildren when they came to visit. They're just so innocent and sweet and precious. It was just a joy to have them around. They make me forget about all the pain in life. planting seeds for some vegetables, making a garden. That's great. What made you decide to do that? I read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands in dirt, so I decided to find out. Plant something and watch it grow. How did you find your ideal weekend? Sitting on the beach, facing the water, thinking, talking to God, wishing I was somewhere else. Like Hawaii. Penthouse over Maui. That I could trust people. That I wouldn't lash out at them. That I could sleep at night. Crazy. Hot headed. Emotional. Being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Don't trust anyone. Be careful. Be wary of people and what they want from you. people and what they want from you. I have grandchildren. I don't have a real family. I haven't seen my brothers in like 20-30 years. I only have two brothers, and I don't, haven't seen them. My mother's family, I haven't seen in years. My father's family, I haven't seen in years. My parents are dead. My son lives in another state. Wow. Some of the older people that I give care to, sometimes I'm a caregiver, so sometimes the people that I work with are older and wiser. I'm loyal, spiritual, supportive, kind, generous.

442,36,1," Okay. All right. You're welcome. Anytime you're ready. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Okay. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I live today pretty well except for drab weather. I see what you mean. Where are you from originally? Originally I'm from Detroit, Michigan. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? Back in the 80's. That's a long time. Yeah. How often do you go back to your home? It's been a while. The last time it's been about five years. How does it compare to LA? Not even close. More setback out here is you have the weather. That's the prominent reason for coming is the weather. Why did you move to LA? Because maybe better opportunities and the weather. Are you happy you did that? Yes. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It took a minute. I had to adjust to the different attitudes of the people, the surroundings, locations, and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another. I understand. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, the weather, for one. It never snows in Southern California. Two, the prospects of starting a business or becoming self-employed and doing what I like to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The people. Can you tell me about that? They're not friendly for no one's friendly out here, you know back east and I'm from and was raised in the south Where everybody's cordial friendly high when you pass in the streets out here people think that you have Some agenda just for saying hello in passing. So that's what I don't like about about LA. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I used to be on the road a lot. I was a truck driver and plus an entertainment coach driver for several Motown bands back in the day. So I'm used to traveling, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? Well, this is actually a beautiful country, so just viewing the country side of visiting different towns different cultures different towns and seeing how basically how the rest of the country lives some not so good some bad and some good let's see Denver Colorado I live in Denver for a couple years which is really a great city and then I lived in Atlanta which is a really a great state where you know you have the southern uh southern attitude southern attitude where everybody's friendly and gets along and and let's see i've been back and forth across this country at least 16 to 20 times so yeah it's it's been it's been it's been an adventure what's one of your most memorable experiences uh arkansas little rock where i had to get into a uh you might want to say altercation with the rednecks down there because as you know I'm African American and down there they're very prejudiced. You know they're the southern, what were the rebels? Not rebels but what were they? Confederates. They still have this tendency of thinking blacks or any other culture besides whites aren't valuable people. Yeah, so I had an incident down there where it actually turned into a shootout. But I'm okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A little of both. It depends on the time, on the period. It depends on what mood I'm in at the time, you know. I can be outgoing because I do like to go to nightclubs and listen to live music, live bands, and I know, like I said, I did some entertainment before, so at clubs, I'm more outgoing, and social events, more shy. Okay. Meditate. How are you at controlling your temper? Very good. Very good. Because if I let my temper get the best of me, I tend to cause more harm than good. You know, harm to the person, harm to myself by, you know, physical altercations or going to jail. So, yeah, I'm very good at controlling my emotions, my temper. What was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Good question. Okay, girlfriend. We just recently broke up about two or three weeks ago because of an argument about what she thought she could do and what I know she couldn't do, and she wanted to do it anyway. So that led to an argument, and the argument ended in us breaking up. So, yeah. How hard is that? It was emotional, but I'm 55 and it's not my first breakup, so I just take it in stride and move on. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. well it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time it's probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but uh i would say back in the day back in the 80s when me and my wife broke up I think I could have handled that one better because I was younger, more hot-tempered, and more irrational. So I could have handled that one better, yes. What made you decide to do that? The way I handled that situation? Well, like I said, being young and inexperienced in emotions and attitudes and not being able to communicate with another person on a level of understanding. Leaving home. Well, it was like, what can I say? It was about 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning, and I just decided to pack up and leave without letting anyone know that I was leaving. That was like one of the hardest decisions that I had to make. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Sketchy. Loving, but sketchy. My family's in Detroit and Atlanta, Georgia. I'm in California, L.A. I have no one out here so I'm basically on my own and I've been on my own for a long time so we communicate and we talk and sing Christmas cards Thanksgiving cards you know and that fact but as far as family it's it's sketchy no one or something that you wish you could erase from your memory? Hmm. I don't know. Most things that I don't want to remember, I don't. And I have erased a lot of things from my memory or placed them in a closet which I can't open anymore to remember that. But the most thing that I can say is I won't go into detail on it, but an incident where it caused great bodily harm to a person. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? In the last two weeks, I've had this heartburn problem. So in the last two weeks, it's been really difficult for me to get some sleep. In my pocket right now, I have a jar of Tums. It's keeping me pretty sedated right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. How have you been feeling lately? Anxious. I need to get things done. And I feel like I have people and things that's against me and trying to block everything that I'm doing to succeed. And that's been a great disturbance to me. That sounds really hard. Yes, it is. But, you know, like I said, I take everything with a grain of salt, and I keep pushing because you can't stay mad or vengeful at any one person or any one thing too long because it doesn't accomplish anything. So I have to keep pushing. Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or thought process? No, basically I'm still the same. I just keep my ideas that I need to do and try to accomplish what I need to accomplish. Post-traumatic stress? No. Yes. Back in 2009. 2009. Crying a lot, not trusting, suspiciousness of other people. So what, and I was recommended and referred to a medical, mental health facility for treatment. Do you still go to therapy now? Off and on, yes. When I feel depressed and feel anxiety building up in me, yes, I still have treatment. Do you feel like you're a disease person? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Oh, when I was really, really happy when my girl that I just broke up with came from upstate for us to be together. That's when I was really, really happy.

444,36,1," Okay. So she's going to ask you some questions and then when she's done she'll let you know, she'll say goodbye and then you can press this button to let me know that you're done. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions, but I'll start with you. And please feel free to contact me. Your answers are clearly confident. Are you okay with this? Yes, I'm fine. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing very well today. I feel good today. Where are you from originally? Born in Indiana. Really? Mm-hmm. Grew up in Bloomington. I moved to L.A. for a job working with the CDC. I've only been back twice in the past 20 years. My family's not there anymore. I went back for high school reunions. How does it compare to the land? It's much greener. It's very green, very small, very wooded areas. That's where I played in the woods when I was a kid. We'd swim in the quarries. I rode my bicycle everywhere. And here it's a little more cement and traffic. How easy is it for you to get used to living in the lake? It just seemed like cement at first, but I love it now. And I have friends and I love being able to do so many different things. And I go to the beach a lot. I also go up to the mountains I go camping all the time so I love it always opportunities I'm sure you can tell by my shoes I'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot? I have traveled quite a bit I was in the Peace Corps and I was in South America I was in Paraguay for three years and I traveled all through South America Brazil, Peru, Chile Bolivia I also spent a year in London, traveled all through Europe, and I used to go to Canada often. I'd love to get to Asia one of these days. Meeting new people, the food. I love trying new food and just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's outlook on the world. because America tends to become isolated. I hiked the Inca Trail when I was in Peru. That was a five-day hike starting out of Cusco. We hiked for, I think, what, four or five days and woke up the last morning at the sun gate of Machu Picchu. And that was just the most amazing experience because I had only seen it in National Geographic, you know, all my life. So to be there and experience that was phenomenal. Philosophy. I have a degree in philosophy. I minored in art. well I started out in business and I got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so I decided to study what I wanted to study while I was in college and had the opportunity so that's what I wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher but I had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of ethics. But that kind of fell apart. And that's actually how I ended up joining the Peace Corps. So it all worked out. I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry, my alarms going off on my phone. It'll die in a second. Okay, I'm sorry. It's still going. Sorry, I turned off the phone, but I forgot to turn off the alarm. That should go. Okay, I'm sorry, what was your question? My dream job? Gosh. Writing. Writing. I've done a few scripts some screenplays with a friend of mine but I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing but writing and teaching and traveling if I could do that overseas so outgoing should I turn off my alarm it keeps going here oh I can't move okay I can't get to my purse okay I'm sorry yes I turned off my phone but I didn't turn off the alarm it's like I forgot it's my alarm to go to yoga class I'm terribly sorry about that okay sorry for the interruption okay sometimes when I'm doing something I turn on the fish tank screen okay I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got what do you do to relax? I have an actual fish tank at my house and I do the same thing and I do that with my children when they get upset I sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing. I also try and meditate. I try and just sit down and be quiet and gather my thoughts. I like to read and or sometimes I walk. I'll take my dog for a walk. I wish I could say I was good at it but usually I tend to have outbursts every once in a while when things are getting too chaotic at my house and I'm feeling very underappreciated I will have a burst of anger yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that and I've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family I've done it and then instead of recognizing that I'm upset about it, my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad. And then that escalates. And sometimes I just end up walking out the door or going to my room. Hmm? I'm sorry. I usually, after I have an outburst and I isolate myself for a little bit, I can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner um sometimes it's very hard but I I've gotten to the point where I know just to stop and and get myself out of there and and go take some deep breaths um and then really try and figure out what I'm feeling, why I'm being angry, why am I being so tense, and then be able to verbalize that. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. Well, it happens a few times when I start getting, I've had a very tense day, and things haven't gone right. I tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while I'm making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the TV or, and my husband's bothering me about things that I just don't need to think about right then. And one time I just said, okay, everyone out of the kitchen, leave me alone, get out, just let me finish dinner and nobody would and I just it just had more pressure building up and building up and I actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard to just like get people to pay attention to what I was saying and actually made a dent in my stove which is still there um so that that I should have um walked out sooner and taken my deep breasts before I did that. It was probably when I was pregnant with my first child. I wasn't married. I had a very good friend. Oh, I was, I was 32 at the time. So I was, you know, I wasn't young. I think if I was younger, I probably would have decided to have an abortion. But at that point in my life, I'm like, okay, I'm going to have this child. And I had, I got pregnant by the man I actually married and still marry to. But we had only been dating like three months. And I was living with a good friend of mine who I'd been in the Peace Corps with. And she, and so I didn't know this guy very well. I didn't know if we could raise a child together. I didn't know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else. and my friend suggested that we raise the child together even suggested moving to Costa Rica to raise the child together and so it was a lot of huge decisions that were going to determine the rest of my life and I made the decision based on more common sense and practicality but I don't regret that decision I think I made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child. They're older now. My oldest is 17. He is at Da Vinci Science School, and he's very much into engineering. He is getting his pilot's license, which I'm very proud of him for. um then my daughter is 15 and she loves acting uh she um she has a boyfriend who um they see just once a week at church basically um and they text each other constantly um she's a very very typical 15 year old and then i have a 12 year old he is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises, but I love him dearly. He is into rock climbing, and there's a rock climbing gym near our house, so he has a membership there, so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis. Nice. Do you find it easy to do it again? No. I find it extremely difficult. I wasn't ??????????????my mother had a very ??????????????my dad died when I was young, and my mother kind of disconnected when that happened. So I dth my mother or growing up and I basically raised myself. I was kind of on my own from a very young age. I mean, she was at the house, but really I had no interaction with her. So I really didn't have parenting skills that, you know, most people are raised with. I know what not to do, but sometimes it's very difficult. And I see my friends that have, you know, these very innate parenting skills, these very warm and, you know, they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and, you know, their house is always perfect. And it's like, I'm just not that person. So I, I, I try and be I think I am a very good mother but I'm not a typical mother I think I'm more I'm more creative a lot of times and we do a lot of things but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing actually when we go camping it's more I'm more homey when I go camping than I am at home I think I'm more tense when I'm at home but I'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort I'm trying to become calmer and more patient I think my patience is what um I need to work on the most I've been an insomniac all my life I remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and um I haven't slept well for a long time um but I realized that if I exercise and I do something with my brain intellectually during the day I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well um and that's sometimes that's hard to do and so a lot of times I stay awake reading I'll read till midnight and then I'll try and go to sleep and usually I won't get back up even if I I'll wake up at three again and things of that sort but I'll try to go back to sleep yesterday I didn't feel so good I was I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and it was all cloudy and gray yesterday because I planned on working on my garden. I'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard. I had some more planting to do and I just didn't feel like doing it. I just piddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday. Today, I feel really good. I feel more positive. I feel more energy. No. No. I don't know. I just got a new mattress, actually, that hasn't really helped me sleep. But it was really good because I've needed one for a really long time. And I was just kind of excited about being delivered and set up. And that sounds like sort of mundane. But it was, you know, just like, I'm finally doing something positive, because it's, it's something that I put off doing and put off doing and put off doing and it was like finally there and concrete and it's like okay I've done this task that I can check off my list but also I took the kids camping over spring break and we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and around the campfire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy I don't know I think she believes that I'm more intellectual and smarter than I think that I am at times so she comes to me with a lot of issues she always solicits advice from me She thinks I give her good advice. And when she doesn't know what to do, she'll ask me. And then sometimes she just calls me to run things by, just like to complain about because I'm sympathetic or empathetic. And I'm just there to listen, and I don't need to give her any advice. So I think a good listener and good advice giver. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I procrastinate a lot. I start projects and I don't finish them. So that's what I'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that I've started over the past few months. A lot of them are really creative projects and I'm very enthusiastic about them when I start them and I'll get almost finished. And then I don't know what happens. I just completely lose interest. sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but I'm working on that I'm trying to get those done oh gosh not following through on the opportunities I had when I got out of the Peace Corps there was a lot of things that I could go into I could have gone to get my master's degree on a grant and things of that sort. But instead, I got pregnant and got married. And I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed. But then when I got pregnant, the second time, it was right at a time where I had to fight for a directorship. And I realized my limitations where I couldn't be pregnant and have this child and do everything I needed to do to get a directorship and so I really wish so I resigned and I wish I had stuck with that because then I would have have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career not to base decisions on emotions Sometimes I am and not I've had some really bad bosses. The jobs were wonderful, but my ego got in the way. And I would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job, let go of the the egotistical reactions that I had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well. My children, actually. And also, my Peace Corps experience was just phenomenal. And people are actually really interested in that. And they're like in awe that they actually know someone who actually did that. So that that's, I'm, I always when I was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the Peace Corps when it first started and I always said oh I want to do that one day I want to do that one day I want to do that one day and then finally I got to the point where I said I either have to shut up or do it so that's that was one of my prouder experiences okay thank you Bye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/444_P/444_AUDIO.wav,1
445,27,1," So if I say take off your top, will she do it? Okay. She's kind of hot. That's my kind of woman. Alrighty then. Thank you. to people in a safe and secure environment.

What do you enjoy about traveling? Well, it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures. I'd love to hear about your trips. I worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer and traveled to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, Korea, Japan, and the Caribbean Islands. Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Being in Galena, Alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snowstorm and surviving. Wow. How did you feel in that moment? Like I was on the edge of death and life but I lived. What did you study at school? school? The arts and business. How did you decide to do that? I don't know. I was attracted to the arts at a young age and business went along with it. Cool. Are you happy you did that? Yes. Are you still working in that? Yes. What's your dream job? To be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life. That's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More outgoing. Why? I always feel very confident with my thoughts and I like people to know what I have to say. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Um, I listen to music and I sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when I'm stressed out. How are you at controlling your temper? I could work on that. I'm not very good at that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night with my girlfriend, she was asking my advice on something and as I was speaking to her, she felt my tone of voice was too loud. I was not angry, but I was irritated that I was being told to quiet down when I didn't really want to help. I just wanted to relax. I agree. sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal it's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier Well, when I was taking care of my mother and she was dying of COPD and then it turned into lung cancer, I chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful. And I had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse, but I couldn't tell her the truth. And I let her think that everything was okay. Wow, that sounds really hard. It was. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. My mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline. That's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts. If I could erase that, if that never happened, I would feel better. How do you cope with that? Oh, I don't know. I try to be grateful I'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives and not dwell on the negative things of my memory. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My girlfriend. She's a very good positive influence. She wants me to be a better person. Can you tell me about that? I understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Are you triggered by something? That's unknown. I don't know. It just happens. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling good. My reality is I've been hit with a lot of financial problems, but I'm handling them well actually. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I've been looking at it as my girlfriend has told me that I need to do this. So therefore, it is on the forefront of my mind right now. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Today, when I woke up and it was a sunny, beautiful day, and I had a lot of goals to achieve, and I'm achieving each one one by one, It gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness. That's great. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend. That's something we enjoy to do. Going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit. How would your best friend describe you? Probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart, but has a short fuse and Maybe complains about his own life too much. I wish I could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side. Well, one time I had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings I did he thought was horrible and I felt it was the best thing I'd ever done. So that, and I don't understand how anybody could feel that way and I didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest evaluation. So therefore I felt bad about that. I see. As it's my goal. Do you regret? No, nothing I regret. I felt... Hmm, 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. the other. When things don't go my way and finances come down and I don't get jobs that I go for that I am qualified for but I feel I'm not getting my fair chance at opportunity, It's very frustrating. I don't really feel guilty about things. Sometimes maybe if I'm angry and I shouldn't be, I feel guilty about that. I don't ever want to be short with my girlfriend ever. She doesn't deserve somebody using vulgar language or shouting or something. So I don't want to be that way around her. So for that I am guilty. What are you most proud of in your life? My achievements, my abilities through my music and my other abilities that I have. My hard work has paid off and I'm very proud of those. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay, thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. I like her. Can I have her in my house to talk to me every day? Do you want to take her home with you? I'm going to stop the recording. Sorry, you have to say goodbye to her.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/445_P/445_AUDIO.wav,1
446,20,1," Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm wonderful. How are you? I'm great, thanks. Where are you from originally? California. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather is one of them. The food and the way everything is centrally located. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic, the smog, and it's just gotten really, really overcrowded. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I wouldn't say a lot, but I do try to travel at least once or twice every two years. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just exploring different things and being able to have different experiences, things of that nature and you know learning new things and just different cultures I like to learn about different cultures and when you travel you get a sense of you know feedback from different cultures in different areas so I like that well I just came from Miami last year I went to Miami for a week and a a half. It was really nice. The weather was great. It was my first time going and the weather was wonderful. The people were really nice and it was really a great experience. I went out there for a particular event. They have something every year where everyone comes out from all over and you just kind of party and hang out and meet new people. It was really fun. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Well, from that trip I would say swimming in the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Miami Beach waters. It was wonderful. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was. What did you study at school? Child development. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I've always been interested in children since I was younger. I babysat a lot, so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age. And as I grew older, I realized that it was something that I liked to do. So that's when I looked into child development courses and I thought that it was something that I would enjoy doing. So I started taking classes and the rest is history. Are you still working in that? I am, yes. It's been 15 years in August. Wow. Yeah. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would say to become a principal. Why? Well, it's something that I've thought about doing for a while now, and I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going. So I'm going to be back in school, and I'm going to be taking courses so that I can make that happen because it is a dream of mine. Yeah, thank you. How hard is that? It's going to be pretty difficult. There is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me, and, you know, it's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's something that I'm up for because it is a dream job of mine, so it's something that I'm willing to do. I understand. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? A little bit of both, I think. A little bit of both. I can be shy at times and outgoing as well. But I think a little bit of both, I would say. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tank screensaver. I meditate I'm a big big meditator so I love meditating I love just reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time how are you at controlling your temper? oh wow I'm very, very good at that. Very good at controlling my temper. I, um, again, um, a series of meditation that I do. Um, it involves deep breathing and, um, just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat and you can, um, really feel everything in your body. and it really, really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature. Yeah, that helps me a lot. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Oh, wow. It was just recently, actually, unfortunately. it was last week and it was with my husband and um it was about um just the way he responds sometimes to me uh it can be a little aggressive um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression I totally tune out and that's actually what happened. So yeah, that was it. How did you feel in that moment? I felt very frustrated and I actually felt angered too, but more frustrated. And I felt saddened too because I don't like arguing. So it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. my responses to certain stimuli. I've kind of got that down. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. Well, it was when I was 16 years old and I became a teenage mother. I was pregnant at 16 and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort and I chose life. So that was one of the hardest decisions, if not the hardest decisions to make as a 16 year old teenager. Just whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself. So that I think was the hardest decision I had to make. How do you cope with that? Well, I mean, my son is almost 19 now, so it's 19 years later. and I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to abort him and being pro-life pro-choice, pro-life and I have not regretted the decision that's my only child and I love him, he is just a blessing he is just a blessing and I feel very special to be his mom I do, yeah No, it's not easy. It definitely has its difficulties, just as anything. But at the end of the day, it is really rewarding. And you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised, become a productive citizen and go out into society and just start making their way. and it's really rewarding. It really is. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Oh, wow. So many ways. The first way is I actually listen to my son, and I accept his feedback, even if I don't like it, and I allow him to express himself. Fortunately, unfortunately when I was little, there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child. It was more like we were just told what to do and we did it. And with my son, I give him options. I allow him to express himself. I allow him to give me feedback, negative or positive, because I feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and as parents you have to be supportive in that and kind of make sure that you nurture that because that's kind of the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so I'm different in a lot of ways in that right thank you Um, well, it depends. Um, sometimes it really depends. It depends on the time that I go to sleep. It depends on the time that I woke up. So it's a lot of factors. Um, I can't just give you one answer. Um, I would say that it varies. Sometimes I can go to sleep, um, and fall asleep right away. And other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep. So it varies. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling great lately. I really have been. I can't say that like I said the last week didn't affect me, you know, the argument with my husband. But other than that, I've been feeling really good. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I haven't. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, I have not. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so i feel really really blessed every day that's great thank you um as um nurturing patient loving friendly kind of reserved. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I wish that I had already completed college and had my master's degree. And sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects. And I could change, if I could change anything, I would change that, those two things. And also, I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert. Is there anything you regret? You know what? No regrets. No regrets. You live and learn. Nothing is perfect. Everything that I've gone through has made me the person that I am today. So I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person that I am today. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Oh man. To stay in school. stay in school and to get your education and to put that first and foremost before a relationship even before your career i really really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education i'm most proud of where I've come from as a teenage mother being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same I've had my same job for 15 years now I'm really proud of that I've been married for 13 years I'm really proud of that happily married to my best friend of my soulmate nothing's perfect but he's my best friend and I love him. And I'm also proud of my son being the mother that I am and the son that I've raised. I'm proud of the job that I've done. And I really applaud myself for that. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. You were wonderful. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Hi. Hi. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/446_P/446_AUDIO.wav,0
447,25,1," Okay, great. Okay, when she says goodbye, press this button and she'll come back in. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, that's perfectly fine. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling great. It's an early morning. I don't have school. I'm excited. Where are you from originally? Born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? The fact that you can surf, snowboard, and do two drastically different things in one day. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Coming from the neighborhoods I've lived in, I'd say the population of lower socioeconomic backgrounds, it's like a cesspool almost for young African Americans and it sucks. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really. I've been to New York, Connecticut, Mexico, and Texas, but pretty young. Wow. What do you enjoy about traveling? Mostly, if I'm traveling by plane, just the sight in the air. It's amazing. It's remarkable. I'd love to hear about all your trips. The first time I went to New York, I was about 11 years old, and I made sure I got the window seat on the plane. And just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating. But we left at night here in L.A., and it was the next day in New York, so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change. And the first thing I remember doing was getting a slice of New York pizza, and it was delicious. Nice. Yep. What did you study at school? Graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications, so I can go into the military as an officer. What made you decide to do that? Actually, it's like, I don't know, it's like, you gotta have a plan, and it's the only thing that's just fallen into place, and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me. What's your dream job? To be honest, a job that doesn't exist. It's however you can get paid to do nothing. Yeah. But probably... Have you considered yourself more shy or outgoing? I was definitely shy as a kid, but I've grown into myself through the experience of college, so I'm way more outspoken. That's great. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I write music and I work out mostly, so if I'm feeling stressed out, I'll just do a set of push-ups and lift some weights. How are you at controlling your temper? Has that gotten you in trouble? Not really, it's been more of an interpersonal thing that's, I don't know. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Probably yesterday, something in regards to sports, the playoffs are on, so things like that of that nature. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, so many. I guess in my senior year of high school, I waited to the last minute to apply for the UC schools, and it was unsuccessful because I didn't get to turn in the applications, and I'm pretty sure I would have been admitted, so it sucks, but hey. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. That is an intriguing question. I've actually no clue. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. The death of my grandmother. Can you tell me about that? Sure. My grandmother died when I was 11 years old. She raised me from the time I was born because my mother was unable to take care of me. She raised my sister, my brother, my cousin as well, and her five children. So she was the matriarch of our family and the closest thing I've had to a mother. It was tough, but it's going to be seven years this May next on the 30th. And I've grown quite a bit, no more tears. That's good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm a foster kid, so I was emancipated from the foster program about two years ago now. But my immediate family, I'm pretty close with them. I see them as much as I can. And my foster family, they're awesome. I've known them since I was five, so it's been pretty cool. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Fairly easy. I fall asleep pretty quick. It's not a problem, except for when my back's hurting. Then it's a problem. What are you like when you don't sleep well? A little moody in the morning, I guess. I drive more aggressively. How have you been feeling lately? A little stressed about a few problems that I can take care of, but I shouldn't stress because I either can do something about it or I can't. That's just the way things work. Can you tell me about that? uh sure um i have a few parking tickets not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not making your court date so i had three failure to a piercing court, which suck, tickets that are thousands of dollars, and I have no money, so, I don't know, it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life, but there's so many barriers and obstacles that, like, you didn't foresee, so, I don't know, it gets stressful at times, and, yeah. How do you cope with that? thinking about it for periods of time. Some days I just sit and I'm just lost in my thoughts and I don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me, really. So I just bottle it up like I do everything. How hard is it? Not very. After doing it for so long, it becomes a natural thing, I believe. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm, really happy. Why is that such a difficult question? I don't know. I'm pretty content with everything right now. I don't know about extreme happiness. Every day is just the same day, it seems like. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Dunking across the street at the Clippers Center. There's a basketball court there, and I've been working on it for a while, and I finally got up. Nice. Yeah. How do your best friends grab you? I have four close friends that I've known for over eight years each and I don't know studious hard-working determined I don't know yeah probably my metabolism which I don't really have control over. I don't know, I'm pretty content with myself. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Hmm, I think in my sixth grade year of grade school, I was in the best of students, but I had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me the whole year but I learned a lot and I developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation I overcome after feeling so bad and down. The same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sternness I don't think I would have gained the discipline to be where I I am now in college and stuff, so he's been pretty influential. I remember this time I was in the desert or up in Joshua Tree with my best friend and his dad, and we actually got stuck in the mountains, and we went down a gully, and his jeep wouldn't get over a rock, so it was pretty, yeah, it was kind of weird. I thought I was Superman. I tried to move a rock. That was thousands of pounds. It didn't work. But yeah, we eventually got out. We thought we were going to be stuck in the desert, but it was a fun time. I got to drive in the desert when I didn't have my license, so it was fun. About that day or in general? other than like the UC thing like where I didn't apply to the schools in time I regret that I don't know I was 10 years old 10 years ago I'd probably say to myself I have no clue. That's an interesting question. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? Being the first from my immediate family, as in my mother, my brothers, and my sister to go to college. So, yeah, that's pretty. That's great. Yeah. no problem Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/447_P/447_AUDIO.wav,0
448,62,2," Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions, then I'll start it. And please feel free to comment on anything. Your answers are totally confident. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? What did you study at school? How did you decide to do that? building things and repairing things that intrigued me and I was actually pretty good at it so I stuck with it and that's my profession. That's great. What's your dream job? Gee, I really never had that. I've just kind of always hoped that I would have a job that could support myself and my family and I was satisfied with that. I understand. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I just recently lost my uncle, and he raised me since I was seven years old. And other than my wife, I don't have any more family. He passed away last July, and I'm starting to get over it. I knew the day would come, but he was my last living relative. So I've been depressed about that, but I'm doing better. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? It depends on the atmosphere. If I'm around people that I don't feel comfortable with, I'm kind of reserved. but if I'm comfortable and I feel like I fit in I'm outgoing I enjoy old movies old, well, it's called Film Noir. And I love those old black and white movies. And I get on Netflix or Amazon and I try to pick a movie that's from back then. People were different and they, I don't know, it's just a different era and I enjoy it. Awesome. How long did it take you to become a filmmaker? Well, my wife says I'm probably not as good as I think I do, but I've got to admit sometimes I lose my temper. And it is, according to her, over things that I shouldn't be losing my temper about. But I'm working on it, and I have basically had this problem ever since I was a young child. Oh, yes. Can you tell me about that? I've been in and out of trouble with the law when I was much younger. I'm past that point now. But, you know, when you're young, you think you know everything, and, you know, you're never going to get old, and the future doesn't matter. But it does matter because everything that you do when you're young follows you for the rest of your life. And I don't regret things that I've done, But if I could go back, I definitely would make different choices. Me and my wife, we don't argue. We disagree. And she's very strong-willed, and she's a match for me. So we go back and forth. But we don't get violent, and we don't say meanful things or hurt each other. We're just, she is a determined, strong-willed woman, and I am who I am, so we kind of go back and forth. And lately, I have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run, it's just her and me, and there's nobody else more important to me. When I was younger, I wish that I didn't follow some of the people that I followed. And what I mean by that is, you know, running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense. And that's what got me into trouble. So I was an only child and I kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and getting the girls to laugh or having people think I was cool or whatever. You wouldn't think that now. I'm kind of overweight and balding. But when I was in my 20s, I was a completely different person. And if I would have had some brothers and sisters, I may not have thought or acted that way. But I was an only child. So I, you know, ran where people thought it was cool. And that got me into trouble. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make was giving the authorization to have my uncle pass away. He was on life support and his kidneys had failed. And the doctor said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him go through any suffering to let him slip away. And as you can see I get very upset. My uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down. and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button I never thought of it have to do that but as I said I'm getting over it and things are getting better slowly My wife, she is always there for me. She will always surprise me. She's not my wife, she's my best friend. And she knows me better than I know myself. We enjoy doing simple things. It's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to, but we mesh. We enjoy each other's company. We like the same things, and we, you know, occasionally go out and do something together, but we just enjoy each other's company, and she, like I say, knows me better than anybody, and it surprises me sometimes. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? you know, lately, well, I can't say lately, if I don't, excuse me, if I don't do a rigorous activity or something that really stresses me or strains my body, let's say for a couple of days, I'm just very relaxed and, you know, not doing much, I just automatically get up after four and a half, five hours. I mean, and, you know, my wife will say, you know, you're not getting any sleep. But, I mean, I don't feel tired. I don't feel exhausted. I don't feel like I need to go back to sleep. I'll stay up all day, and I'm fine. And most people will say that's not enough sleep. But, you know, for me, it doesn't affect me. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I wish some things could be different, but I'm not dissatisfied. I'm happy with my life. Like with anybody else, there's a few things that I wish were different, and I think that's in everybody else's, you know, life. But I'm content. I'm content. Yeah, I feel a little less motivated. Um, recently, well, I can't say recently, this was back in January. Um, my wife and a few, uh, friends were noticing that I was, um, becoming forgetful and I, I couldn't remember things. I didn't see it. And, um, you know, when they, when everybody brought it to my attention, And then I started to. Anyway, I went to the doctor. And they gave me the tests. And apparently I have MCI, which is mild cognitive impairment. And over the last month or so, nobody has mentioned it to me. I mean, maybe I'm getting better. But the neurologist that I saw is having me come back in a year and going to retest me. hopefully it's not the beginning stages of Alzheimer's I'm still a little young for that, I'm only 52 but I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also I was told by him because of the death of my uncle I could have been very depressed and I was not able to retain things so I'm going back in a year and we'll see if I'm any better I'm sorry I'm not understanding you I'm sorry no no I have not yes 2001 I was in a, what is the word I'm looking for? I was in a state of mind of where I was just going to get myself in trouble and not benefit anything if I didn't seek any help. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, worrying and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst and I take medication for that. Do you still go to therapy now? Well, you know, it's not really therapy. It's, you know, every few months, you know, you got to see the doctor. Are you doing fine? Everything good? And, you know, they just refill your prescription. It's, you know, it's, you know, kind of like the next person, next person. I'm with Kaiser, so it's, they'll talk to you, but they give you the impression that, you know, okay, let's move along. You know, they'll hear your explanation, but, you know, they don't have all the time for you that you may want. So, I'm doing fine though. If I really needed help, I would do something. The medication works for me. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. last time I felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is I'm always happy when I'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and I'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and I don't have anything else she is my world but I enjoy being with her and we do things together and I'm happy all the time when we're doing that when I'm outside of that circle I don't know if this sounds right but I'm not seeking happiness I can only explain it as I'm content I'm not I'm not disappointed or I'm not wanting anything whatever comes my way is fine So, well, I don't know. I couldn't give you that answer. Well, my best friend is my wife, but she would describe me as I don't think before I speak. I let the littlest insignificant things bother me and I get angry over but the big things it's like I let it go and she's bewildered by that. Years and years ago I had a classic Pontiac Le Mans and she had gotten to a minor fender bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world because that was my baby and i you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she she thought i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money, you know, it gets crashed and it's like you don't care. So that's the only way I can explain it. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I need to lose some weight, as you can see. I've definitely been on an eating binge and the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle. This is the heaviest I've ever been in my life and I'm finding it a little bit harder. I can't say harder, but I'm finding the willpower to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or movement, going maybe for a walk. You know, me and my wife, when we were a little bit younger, we used to love going for walks. And we lived in a... Hey, boy, you know, look at that. I wonder what's inside there. You know, we don't do that no more. I guess it's... We're a little bit older now and a little bit heavier. it's harder to walk with all this weight. But I wish I could change that because this is not a healthy size. Lately? No, I don't regret anything lately. Everything's been fine. Like I say, the biggest biggest impact on my life was the event with my uncle and I never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that I would face that situation and I'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and it does What advice would you give yourself to someone 20 years ago? They're invincible, and so did I. I figured, ah, I'm never going to have those problems. I wish I could have changed some things. The history of my past follows me, as it does everybody, and that has limited me in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that I'm able to do. I don't miss them, but if I could go back 10 or 20 years, I definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that I made. What are you most proud of in your life? restoration and working on vehicles and I don't see it but I've been told that once or twice but I I've kind of I've kind of started to slip away from that I don't I can't say it from lack of interest but I just don't feel the motivation no more I wish I had a pocket of money and I'd have somebody else do it that's how I feel okay well thank you bye-bye Hey. Okay. Well, I'll tell you, you know, after a couple of minutes, you...",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/448_P/448_AUDIO.wav,1
449,22,1," Thank you. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes, I am. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm good. Thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? Originally from Los Angeles and my parents are from Central America. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. I like that I can get to the water if I want to, to the hills or hike or just any element that I want to get to, I can get to. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic, busyness, everybody's always in a hurry. That's about it. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Nice. What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Recently I went to Honduras. Again, that's where my family is from. So it's sort of like a dual fold. I get to see my family, but I also kind of get to be away from home. So I do it by not imposing on them. I visit them, but I stay in a hotel. So that way I can still kind of have my freedom and not feel like I'm obligated to be with them. So it's more fun that way. That makes sense. What's one of your most memorable experiences? experiences on vacation or probably Hawaii in Lahaina and just having I love food I'm a foodie so having the pig roasted on the ground and just eating it that way it's just I've never been able to taste it that way anytime else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me because no matter what I do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in Lahaina What did you study at school? Business, and that was years ago, so I ended up in the marketing field. So I've enjoyed, my business background did help me in the marketing field. What's your dream job? My dream job, hmm. Well, I guess it would have to do with food. I love to cook, and the only reason I hesitate is because I love to cook, but I just do it for home and friends and family. If it were to turn into a job, I feel as if it would just not be as joyous or I wouldn't have as much fun as I do have it, you know, as I have now. But if I could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that I have in cooking every day now, then that would be my dream job. I'm outgoing. I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. That's cool. How do you move your relax? Depends on where I'm at. Wherever I'm at, actually, the first thing I do is just kind of get a hold of myself. That way I'm always in control no matter where I'm standing at. And I always say that I am my own peace, P-E-A-C-E. So I just kind of just take a deep breath, assess my situation, figure out what I can control, what I can't control, and then proceed from there. But just sort of just kind of breathe and get a hold of myself first. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm actually very good. I'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with. I don't really let anything agitate me. And so if I do feel myself just getting hot or if I just react, I just sort of just, like I said, just do my own little self-check. You know, I might have cussed. I might have went off for a second. But I do my own little self-check and just say, you know what, come on now. It's not worth it. This person is not worth it. This situation is not worth it. Be who you are and just stay there. actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kind of overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it I'm not asking you to make me feel any differently. I'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings. When I got to my own conclusion, I felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how I felt, not for him to impose his, you know, he's a very macho kind of manly guy. I didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic. And so I said no. I felt better because I felt understood and I felt heard. hmm let's see i get my son comes to mind he's 22 years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting for him to call me. And I think, that may be a very weird answer, but I wish early on in my life as his mother, I would have kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him. He doesn't live with me, he has his own place. But waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and try to make sure that he's okay, I think this is probably way more ethereal than you meant, but I would have done that differently. I would have mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age, meaning that I would have treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kind of you know I would have killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense oh no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own and I guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay, you're okay. So my son, my daughter, they both know I love them unconditionally. So my parenting has become easier the more and more I've lived in that truth where I'm not expecting anything from them, but then also not expecting any disrespect. So as long as we have that clear line of communication, whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect. That's good. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? seeing them maybe make decisions that I wish they wouldn't make. It could be as simple as an outfit, you know, choice or as much as a career change. But having to sit back, watch them listen, be open, and then just kind of just be there, you know, if they want to talk about it, but then not also also try not to manage them. Because I was also their age. And I have to remember that I didn't want to be managed. And even if I made a mistake, I didn't want to be judged. So the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own. And just sort but kind of just waiting around. And luckily it's nothing major with my kids, but whatever that personal downfall is, just kind of being there and not having, and I told you, I told you so, spirit on me. It's fulfilling knowing that, you know, I created this, you know, I planned both my kids. So it's just, it's a real, it's an honor that I was able to do it. It's an honor that they're healthy. And it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own. and it's like they're mini-me's but then they're also different than I am and so it's fun just being able to allow them and be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so I'm enjoying that. What are some ways that you're different from your parents? Wow completely my parents immigrated here from Central America in the 60s I was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the American lifestyle and which was not a bad thing. It's just that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home, making sure we had the shelter, of course, and food and clothes and schooling. But there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter, to me as a daughter, or my father to me as a daughter. So I had to kind of figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had. Divorcing my first husband, because I was going to be the one that toppled that whole situation. He was a good father, just not a good husband to me. And after 20 years, I knew that I was going to be the one to say this is not working for me anymore. And since I did that, the domino effect was, this is not virtual, it happened. We ended up selling our house, you know, dividing up the assets and then living separately. And then my kids were kind of in between for a little while. And then I just made some decisions to where I didn't want to go through so much court hassle. So I just did a Tina Turner and said, just give me my name, you keep everything else. So it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids. That's all I cared about. In terms of losing everything, physical and all the material stuff, I could care less. But it was hard because I knew it was going to affect my kids and they were the only thing I was concerned about. What made you decide to do that? My husband and I did not, you know, see eye to eye on certain things regarding our marriage. I didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife. And that's just who I am. And those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in. He just kind of saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars, whether it was just travel or whatever the case may be. I'm not here to talk about that part of it. Bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of, you know, the sanctity of our home, and I was tired of just, you know, working and him benefiting from everything, but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife, and he wasn't prepared to change despite all the counseling he went through, and I thought, well, this is not working for me, and I have to take care of myself first and I had low self-esteem I mean I wasn't perfect I had a lot of things going on with myself and I had to learn how to love myself in order to in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that I should get in return you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day I just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes I made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when I put my head down at night I just I asked myself that you know did I do anything that I'm ashamed of today did I cross anybody did I not do you know and I'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if I'm Pollyanna but I believe in karma I'm a God-fearing woman so I just want to make sure that I did everything I was supposed to do today and if there's something I can rectify you know I just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day. Really good, light, you know, had some rough patches with the family individually, like I said, with my son, my daughter's a teenager, so she's kind of coming into her own, so that's a different relationship, she's opposite of me, I'm actually very easygoing, very bohemian style, she's very social, very, you know, just out there, so I'm having to just kind of find our balance, but overall, it's just, I won't complain, I'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that I just kind of foster on my own every day and I just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I haven't. Thank God. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Really happy. Let's see. I was at home and I think it was when wow different things running through my head um I think when my daughter and I my teenage daughter and I came to understand understanding on our mother-daughter relationship I'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me and I think when she came to me the other day just kind of gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything I really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that I accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and I kind of knew about it, but it gave me just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. How are your best friends growing up? I'm easygoing. I'm fun. I'm just very, you know, a chameleon comes to mind. I just kind of acclimate to whatever situation I'm in. I'm very honest. I'm very real and just, you know, bold if I have to be. I'm just very adult I'm an adult woman and you know they would just describe my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable I do as I say I say what I do and I just you know I don't I don't deal with bs what are some things you would change about yourself hmm what can I change about myself uh probably cosmetic things maybe I would just that's not even true let me think what what are some things i would change about myself um sounds weird that i would say not nothing really um i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i'm i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i want to get through my yoga or i want to do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody I don't have any regrets I think about that all the time and you know this is natural to go back and say if I were in that situation with the mindset I have now what would I do but the reality is that I know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so I can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because I know I learned from it probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how I live so I believe that everything good, bad, ugly, or indifferent happened for a reason. I truly believe that. And my job is to take from it what I'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future. So I'm going to take the, you know, the hard knocks with the joys. Be real with myself. That's one thing that took me 20 years to kind of get to, just to kind of be honest with myself, to embrace who I am, to just, you know, get to know who I am, learn my own infrastructure, be comfortable with the innate things that are a part of me. Don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that I'm not. I would have still chosen the same marketing career. I would have still climbed the same corporate ladders, but I would have done it from a more internal place. Not that I lost myself in it, but when in terms of my family life, I would have just been more true to myself and that way I wouldn't have had any kind of resentment. What are you most proud of in your life? My family, my role as a wife, my role as a mother. I think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what, at the end of this life, this life in this body, in this leased vehicle that I'm in, all I'm going to do or all I'm going to be is an epitaph somewhere in a cemetery. And I'm always just true to that. I mean, I've been always true to that from the time I was 18 and realized I wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that. I think that ultimately that's where my true fulfillment comes from. Yeah. Okay. I think I've asked everything you need to. Cool. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. That's cool. That's cool. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/449_P/449_AUDIO.wav,0
450,44,1," Okay. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confident. Okay. Are you okay with this? I'm okay with that, sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. Reasonably well. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Santa Monica, California. Born and raised. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the ocean. I love the hiking. I love... you can have a little bit of every world here. The ocean, the sea, the desert, the weather's great. I get to wear shorts a lot of times out of the year. That's great. What are some things you don't really like about the world? The smog, the cement, road rage, traffic. It's a lonely town. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. I haven't seen your shoes. Well, I haven't seen your shoes. But I have traveled, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? Well, it depends where you're going. I love going to Hawaii. I love the beach, change of scenery, the temperature of the water, different foods, the airports. I love traveling. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I recently went to Europe. I was in Belgium for two weeks. And I ate some great food and saw family and visited some museums. And it rained, which it doesn't do in California, in Los Angeles very much. And I got to take the train and lots of trains and public transportation. That was fun for me. That's normal for them, but it's fun for me. Man, I got to see family, and it was very, very nice. That sounds like a great situation. Yes, it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Why? I'm gregarious. I do well in crowds and groups. I am a good public speaker. Yeah. I'm not so shy. I don't think. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I go fishing. When was the last time that happened? Two days ago. Nice! How do you feel in that moment? I also meditate. How do I feel in that moment? Relaxed. At peace. Calm. Uh-huh. How are you at controlling your temper? Depends on the situation. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? with accepting the situation as it was and not really wanting to deal with it. Sort of like, fuck you. No, it was good. Oh my gosh. The sale of my business. I wish I would have handled that differently. I didn't have to really sell the business, but I got scared and I sold it and I could have handled it in a much different way. What made you decide to do that? Fear. Can you tell me about that? I was afraid of mounting debts. I was afraid of the economy wasn't good. This is 2007-2008. I was not thinking clearly. I was afraid of mounting debts. I was afraid of being sued by employees. I was afraid of, yeah, not having enough money. I was afraid to be embarrassed. I was embarrassed, you know, for running out of money. Yeah, I would have handled that much different, knowing what I know today. That sounds really hard. It was. Did you have done anything to avoid it? Yes, I could have. I could have downsized. I could have downsized, sold cars, got rid of cars. I could have cut hours. I could have reduced my expenses and sat tight with it and just worked through it and not have reacted out of fear. I see. What did you study at school? When? Whatever comes to mind. I got my bachelor's degree in political science from UCLA, and I just finished a master's degree in education. What's your dream job? My dream job? My dream job is to not work. That's my dream job. To not work. To be of service to people. To, you know, to wear casual clothes. not have to be at a particular place at a particular time to have time to enjoy, you know, the things that I like to do, like fishing and hiking, being with my nephews, being with kids, yeah, and not having to work. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. well um relationship with family okay so who's alive today is my mom my father died when i was 16 my stepfather died three years ago so my mom's alive we have a good relationship she's like and it took a lot of work it took years you know but she's a my we're friends you know we do stuff together um my sister she lives a half a block away from me my sister lives a block away from me. She's got five kids and a husband and a family to contend with. And my sister and I don't get to spend a lot of time together anymore. She's got a life, you know, she's a busy life. The rest of my family lives in Belgium, who I went to go see. And that's all the family that I have. I have an aunt that is very, I'm estranged to, and she lives in Northern California, and we never talk. Why? Because she, she ripped off the family estate, my grand, my grandparents' estate. she she took all the money and all the stuff and and left her grandkids and her and my you know and so uh her sister and my my grandmother's daughter and grandkids and great-grandkids got zero and it was a few few million dollars so we don't talk I don't talk we don't talk and it's sad excuse me can you repeat that wow positive my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man honest uh funny handsome I have a business owner a businessman that I worked for who was an extremely positive influence at least in my professional life I've had a counselor at UCLA who was totally I think of her often and some of the little things that she said to me keep me going in my life now trust the process she told me to trust the process and when people are having trouble and I'm having trouble I take a step back and say you know just trust the process it all works out the way it's supposed to be and there's one more positive influence that I knew in Hawaii that taught me a friend of mine that lives on Kauai that taught me how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and and I love her a lot a great positive influence healthy healthy influence it's not I have back problems so it's hard to sleep at night and I wake up in the middle of the night sort of stretching and straightening out my back I have a back issue that sometimes more often than not keeps me from sleeping good that's okay I'm dealing with it How have you been feeling lately? and where I would have been if I hadn't have done that. A general feeling of I've been a little depressed over the past couple of years, actually. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Well, I've been diagnosed many, many years ago, and I guess depression stays with you, although it gets treated. Um, and, uh, I was diagnosed about two years ago. Uh, I think, I don't know, it asked me that on the questionnaire as well. And, uh, and I sought treatment for it. And then, uh, my insurance ran out and the prescriptions, I couldn't do my prescriptions anymore, but now I'm back on medication, and, you know, so I take medication for my depression. Therapy? Absolutely. I love therapy. Wow, that's huge. Confidence in self. confidence in myself, confidence in my decision making, a general feeling of overall content, a sounding board, you know, when I have stuff that's bothering me that I can't go to the, I feel that I can't go to the person with, I can go to my therapist, and a lot of times the issue is resolved there. It wasn't a big issue or I worked through it or the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation. And in that way, I find therapy to be invaluable actually. That's great. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I believe so. Yes, I was. I believe it was, I think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what I was, that's what I was having. And this was within the last five years. I think it was looking back now what are we 2013 it was 2009 so four years ago not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything irritable on the phone I mean just just anything would get me to fly off the handle and just not able, just shell shocked and not, and hiding it in my house, not opening mail, not being able to concentrate, not being able to deal with, with things that were, that I felt were, well, that were bombarding me. I felt overcome. And the psychiatrist said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder, but, and I was given some medication, which I stayed on for a year or so, or so, and I don't know, through psychiatry and therapist and medication, I was able to come out of my shell a little bit. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. about a week ago I was on a hike and up in Malibu and at this beautiful labyrinth that looked over the Pacific Ocean and we I was with a friend and we were having lunch and I laid down in the grass and took a nap and I felt content. I was happy at that moment, at that moment, that time. About a week ago. Hmm. Honest, sincere, smart. caring, smart. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um... Good question. I'd have to think about that. Okay. Is there anything you regret? uh, yeah, I have regrets in life, you know, everything works out, so, um, you know, if I could change the past, I would have never dropped out of school when I did a long time ago, I mean, I've since gone back and completed lots of stuff, um, I probably would have gone into the military, I think I was going to do that in my early 20s. I'm 55 now. I sort of regret not doing that at that time. I regret selling my business. I regret and of course I can't control this but I regret that my father died when I was so young and he never really got to know me and I never really got to know him I regret I regret not seeing my grandmother enough before she passed away I regret I mean those are the things that I can think of right now not putting away for retirement I regret when I had the money to do it yeah I mean just here that's what I would say what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? stick with it just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and And when it comes to fear or flight, I get the fear and I flight. So sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then everything works out. What are you most proud of in your life? Wow. I'm most proud that I have remained genuine. I'm most proud of being who I am and being basically comfortable with that. And I'm proud of that. I haven't changed to the world. You know, for the world, I haven't changed. I've stayed who I am. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/450_P/450_AUDIO.wav,1
451,30,1," Okay, thank you. Yes. Okay. Okay, other than this laryngitis I have. Where are you from? Cleveland, Ohio. When did you start? In 79, I think it was. How often do you go to the hospital? Once a year, something like that, or less. There's a lot more to do here. They're a little more narrow-minded back there in Republican. Well originally show business, but probably to get away from Cleveland. It was very difficult at first. I'm not used to change. I don't like change very much, you know, having to meet new people and figure out how to make a living. Well, I like the different opportunities you have, the health consciousness, the movies, the variety of things you can do. the places you can go, the weather. What are some things you remember? The driving, the congestion, some of the superficial attitude, the importance. I'm sure you can tell them, too. You're not making a whole story. Do you remember that? Well, not a lot, but I do. I just came back from Vegas to visit relatives. We met there. And I'm going to Mexico next month. Well, seeing the different cultures, I've been to Europe, Greece, France, Italy. I like going to places such as Mexico where it's going to be sunny and just lying out. Last year I went to Arizona and never saw Sedona. That was really an experience, peaceful. About Sedona? Yeah. Well, Sedona is a very energetic place. and I thought it was desert, like flat kind of desert looking, but it was very rocky, and when you land in Flagstaff, there's these beautiful pine trees, and the elevation is high, and then coming into Sedona, it was very beautiful, and after a day, the pain in my back went away that I had there for months. And you had this, even though we went to bed late and got up early, you had this energy so it was really very mystical in life or incident in life Well, being on stage in Boston, and that was great. I loved doing that. Just being with friends and laughing are some of my highest moments, when you're laughing hysterically. Well, I don't know of a particular situation, but when I decorate for special events, and I worked with somebody on a regular basis, and we would just find humor in everything, and just laugh. And I can't think of a particular situation or what we were laughing at, but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and gets my jokes and, you know, I get his and we're just enjoying that moment. What did you major in? Speech and drama. I majored in... Did you major in that? No, not now. How did you get into music? I always was interested in musical comedy. When I was a child, I would sing along to records in my living room. And I was always in choirs in school. And then when I went to high school, I joined the drama club. I just always had an interest and I always had a big personality. Well, I don't know if I have a dream job anymore. I'm 60 and I don't know if I have aspirations anymore towards doing anything. Right now I'd just rather not work and just relax and travel. But I like being creative in any way I can. I like independence. And I kind of have that right now, so I'm okay. Okay. I know it's not Hawaii, but it's just as I've got. What do you do in your life? Well, I watch my favorite television shows that I've recorded. And I also am a Buddhist. I've been a Buddhist for, gosh, since 1988. And I'm a district leader in my community. and we have meetings, and that really helps to center me and bring out my higher self. So if I get tense or nervous, I chant. Sometimes okay, sometimes not. A lot, yes, yes. Less and less though. It's been happening less and less. But, um, yeah, sometimes it's got, it's, it's, um, created difficulties. When is the last time you heard of a person who had a mental health issue? Well, I can't remember an argument. I remember getting angry. It was just when I was on my trip in Vegas. I was driving, and the GPS said stay in the left lane, and I stayed in the left lane, but when I got off the freeway, It brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about four miles out of our way. And I just got very angry for about 30 seconds. And then I had to calm myself down and say, okay, all right, so we're going to be late. And I had to talk myself out of it. So it wasn't really an argument with anybody, but I felt kind of bad that I overreacted. um you mean in my life many yes um gosh there's so many I just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information, like they're not going to use me on a job or something, that I would take an attitude that I'll find something better, it's okay, and move on, as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me. and did I do something wrong and then get angry at them and that whole thought process that really doesn't help the situation. And I do that more often since I started chanting, but I'm not always in my high life condition where I can do that. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. I find a lot of situations hard to make, like what television to buy or something. But I guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences. and um or leaving my comfort place if the decision meant that i had to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me and probably leaving a relationship very hard because you know i get dependent on that relationship so i usually live it out until it's for you know it's they leave or something you know it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on so what i usually do is i don't make the decision and I end up suffering longer So. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can we move on? um well uh it's hard because um i don't know if it's because i have pain in my back and neck but i it's difficult for me to stay asleep i i i don't get a um a deep sleep but because of what I so okay it's hard to say because right now I have this cold and I've had it for two weeks so I've been taking NyQuil and that's been putting me to sleep so I have been sleeping better because of it but last night I woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell But before that all happened, I was finding it difficult to stay asleep. And so, therefore, I'm tired during the day, and sometimes I'm groggy, sometimes I'm irritable. But I'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things or not. Okay. I'm sorry could you repeat that have I studied changes in my behavior no I was not no oh i was like happy last week you know um well i uh was going to um vegas to meet my family it was my my family was flying in from cleveland to, we have a relative in Vegas, and I drove with my friend, and it was my brother-in-law's 70th birthday, so we all went and had a good time in Vegas. I mean, I was struggling through my cold, but it was fun, it was nice. That's great. How many best friends do you have? Well, they think I'm funny. They feel that I say it like it is. They all say they understand me. So people who don't understand me, I think, sometimes don't know how to take me. Because I'll say something, sometimes come across sarcastic. That's just the way I talk. So. The anger that sometimes wells up in me. You know, I just. But although that really made me, I think, a lot of the person that I am. You know, all of your experiences make you who you are, and how you handle them makes you who you are. And if you don't have those lows, you don't really know what highs are. So I don't, I can't really go back and regret, you know, I wish certain things didn't happen or whatever, but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today. and I wish that, well I can, I don't wish, I know that I will have less of these moments where I just burnt out anger or something. I just wish that would happen more or less, that the anger parts would happen less. And they are, so I guess it will happen less. don't give up hope live in the moment and everything will everything will work out everything will work out and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear What are those problems? The fact that now and for the past 20 years, 20-some years, I've been cultivating myself, and I've become a more compassionate person, and I'm able to understand people better and see that they're suffering too and that if you treat people from that respect, that they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too, you're able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you. You're not taking it personally. And at the same time, you're becoming a more compassionate person. And when you're more compassionate, you're happy, and your life is happy. Okay? Okay?

Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/452_P/452_AUDIO.wav,1
453,60,2," Okay. I'm just curious to talk to people in the space and to put them in their own words. I'm not a therapist, but I'm really wondering about people, and I'd love to know about you. I have a question for you, sir. Are you seriously afraid of cancer? Because I'm serious about cancer. Are you a therapist? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing, sir? I'm doing good. That's good. Where are you from, which one? uh, Los Angeles. Really? Uh huh. What's the thing that you hate about Colorado? Convenience. Convenience. Uh huh. What do you hate about Colorado? People, the crowd, traffic, people not, uh, lack of respect. of respect. I'm sure you can tell by your shoes, I'm not much of a road explorer, do you travel a lot? Locally, regionally. What do you enjoy most about traveling? Meeting old people. I love talking to old people. How much do you know about the desert? I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California. And I spend a lot of time with the elders. I talk with them. And they help me out a lot. So I get to hear good stories. That's so good to hear. What's one thing you've seen in the last few years? Going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls that no one else had seen except for my people. That was the most beautiful thing I think I've found. Wow. Do you consider yourself a child or a friend? How many times do you turn on the fish tank screen? I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do when you're around? Nice. How long do you work in the same company? That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? When was it again? And I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand. And they didn't communicate so we had an argument. And I got it settled. I felt caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with. And to not be told what was going on in this person's head and then to have a situation arise. I was kept out. I didn't like that. How do you got a situation that you received a different one? I rather pass. Okay. What's something you feel appreciated? Um, probably the lack of time spent with my grandparents growing up. Can you tell me about that? It's just when they're gone you regret that you didn't miss time with, spend time with them. Yeah. That's all. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm not mad. And something doesn't get you through this anymore. One thing I truly wish I could remember, I was a professional athlete at one time. I had a party until like 4 in the morning and then I did my event at like 10 o'clock in the morning. And I was my team captain and I embarrassed my whole team. And that's one thing I truly regret. I was a professional fighter. Yeah, I've not thought about other people besides myself. What did you study at school? I studied massage therapy and got a nursing degree. A lot of it's just been on job education. What's your favorite thing about life? I'm very close. Due to my own injuries, I just went through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked. And I decided to do that. I wanted to help people too. Are you happy with that? Oh yeah. Are you still working on that? Yes. What's your dream job? I want to paint. That's all I want to do is just paint. Awesome. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Um, I have two sons and it's time for me to, uh, to move on and they're older and they can take care of themselves now. So me leaving the area where my sons are, it's pretty hard. You thought it was your dream? Yeah. What's the best thing about being a human? The reflection of you. The reflection of you. It reminds you so much about yourself. Who you are. What's the hardest thing about being a human? Consistency. Even when you're sick. Being consistent. What are some moments that you're looking for in your family? So communicate. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My family is severed pretty much. So my family, my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight. The rest of the family are all fragmented and scattered around the southwest so it's not very tight at all. Who's family is very popular in South Carolina? I have too many to count. I'll start with my uncle. My uncle was like my dad. He raised me in a good way. He watched out for me. He taught me hard work at a very young age. He also taught me to protect my family. He taught me honor. He taught me love. He's a good man. That's great. How do you deal with sleep? I don't know. I haven't had a good night's sleep in years. I get broken sleep. Why? Dreams. The dreams become too real. How do you help your family? I get up and go to the bathroom. And go back to sleep. I try to. My years of fighting just caught up to me. What do you mean by things that you don't do? Reserved. I try to find things to distract my brain, to think of different ways of doing things. Well I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction. So what I do now is I either paint a garden or cleaning a house, washing dishes, you know, get out and go walk. That's another thing too. I do a lot of walking nowadays. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? Anxiety. How do you feel right now? Have you ever seen a change in your behavior or your personality? Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you into this problem? Were you still going to therapy now? Why did you stop? Oh, the therapist released me. Okay. What's the reason you decided to do this? What I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions. But what I do is now I really practice hard at taking care of myself and getting to those places, the things that strike me, that get me anxious or excited or angry. I learned how to work out of it and realize it's not real. It's not real. It's just the emotion. It's not real. So these are the things, like little mantras that I tell myself. And this has really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren't real. So therapy has helped a lot. I mean, it's just changed my world. Have you been writing a book recently? Yes. around the same time as the PTSD about three years ago in my dreams when I dream I do last night I was just dreaming of fighting and preparing fighters to fight that was another thing too I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight And then stepping in front of thousands of people. And then I always end up fighting in my dreams. So it's always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finished the fight and I didn't. And so it builds anxiety and stress in me. And then I tend to act out of my sleep. Like it was real. Like I was there. Like I smell, taste, feel everything there. I was there. That sounds really nice. Yeah. How do you feel about the last time you felt really happy? This morning? Driving here? Talking to my girlfriend? Yeah. How do your best friends feel about you? Trustworthy. He loves me. I love him. We're best friends. What's still good to you? I have zero to change. I can't recall. Regret. Just not spending time with my grandparents and I think day to day issues maybe. You know, a couple here and there that I should have went to the store first or something like that. But I mean, it's nothing like that. What advice would you give your school parents and parents? Quit thinking, know it all. What would you say as someone who has followed you? How about something you did in your new relationship? I started a new art project yesterday. It was nice. Can you tell me about that? Boy, I... We were in Santa Barbara and we found some rocks. Some old rocks that someone had made a pile of and just threw a dump of old rocks out of the way. And I went through the pile of rocks and I found this old rock that was in the middle of it. And I took it home and now I'm doing an art piece on it. And for me it was like this thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now potentially it'll be sitting on my grandkids table you know it's just to me that's really cool like that Awesome. What are you most proud of in your life? touch it and feel it and I don't think about it. These are the things that I'm proud of. I like that. Accomplishment, I guess you could say. Bye. Her left clavicle needs adjustment. Her clavicle sits higher. It makes her look like she's been in a car accident. She's like this. Her left shoulder is up higher and it's squished in so you're off and it's drawing my attention to that. So I don't know if you guys noticed that too. The other part of it too is the hand motions that she does. Some of the hand motions are very aggressive in the wake so it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like fast moving. Like my therapist because we were working with the PTSD issues, he did everything slowly because I set off on quick trigger movements. And so like with her hand movements like that, coming out like this, talking, it was distracting in the beginning. But besides that, everything is just like, it's pretty, I mean, it's a computer, but it's, I mean, you feel comfortable. It's a good thing. It's a good thing. I'm really glad to hear that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm really glad to hear that. Yeah, yeah. Thanks. No problem. No problem. No problem.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/453_P/453_AUDIO.wav,1

Mostly serving children that are in undeserved areas, giving some outlets and different things that can improve their life. How hard is it? Difficult. Difficult. Monies aren't always there. It's not always easy to go in underserved areas with new ideas, so it's difficult. And I don't have the flexibility just to spend spent all my time doing that. Outgoing. Just not shy.

Could have been a little bit more giving, I guess. Not so stubborn. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Hardest decision. Hardest decision. I think the hardest decision I've had to make of recent would be turning off life support system to an uncle. There was nothing else that could be done for him.

455,18,1," Well, she's pretty fashionable. We'll say that. Yep. So just give her a couple seconds and then she'll start up on her own. And then again when you're finished, just press this button to let me know. Okay. Okay, so just give her a couple seconds and then she'll start up on her own. And then, again, when you're finished, just press this button to let me know. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Very well. That's good. Where are you from originally? Ohio. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to LA? I finished school and came out to start my life. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not often now. Not really often. Because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for, that was my reason for going home prior. How does it compare to LA? There's really not a comparison. You know, this is warm and sunny and that has four seasons, so it's a very different environment. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture, but after I was adjusted, you know, the sunshine keeps you here. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. I love the fact that I have the ocean and the mountains. And so many things that I can choose from and the diversity that I find here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I tend to not have things that I don't like because where I am I know that I'm finding myself there so and I like me so that means that there's really nothing I don't like I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yes, I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love being able to explore different cultures, be able to meet different people, have a different set of experiences, and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between all types of people. It's a very rich experience. Which one? To where? I guess I'm thinking about Egypt and the wonderful experiences that I have there as I go. The people and the warm and loving experience I have, the knowledge I get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids, etc. etc. Things like that. There are so many. There really are. But I can think of seeing a baby in a mosque, which was just really pure and it really stayed with me how similar we actually all are. That's probably one of the things that I remember most from one of my very first trips. there and let's see just the interaction of the people food you know incredible I love the food too Wow I've studied lots of different things I've studied law I've studied entertainment I've I've studied communications. I've studied whatever I want to. I'm quite a renaissance woman. It's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that I enjoy. It keeps me fresh. It keeps me happy. It keeps me alive. and just allows me to be able to be fully developed as a human being, being able to do that. What's your dream job? I don't have a dream job, per se. What I do have is a desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that I choose on a daily basis. so probably more outgoing well I start my day out very relaxed because I start day with meditation and several other spiritual practices that I perform before I move around I get exercise so that I keep everything humming everything moving and then move forward from there how are you at controlling your temper ah excellent I don't really have one anymore when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about argued um cannot remember the last time that I actually had an argument um don't know what it's about I imagine that the last time I argued about something probably might be related to money. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Situation I wish I'd handled differently. You know, I try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hold guilt about the way anything went because they're all, for me, very positive learning experiences that I get to explore who I am through. So I don't really see them as needing them to be different. I need to learn from them or to just really accept what is. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I've ever had to make. don't really have a quote-unquote hard decision you know because I grew up in a way where my mother was extremely wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so um for me decisions don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood so i don't really have a most difficult decision i've ever made okay tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory Hmm, an event that I could erase from my memory? I don't really have one that I can think of that would be so terrible that I would need to erase it. Again, everything for me is a learning experience, so there's nothing really to regret or erase. very easy as soon as I hit the pillow I'm out ah great a little more physical exertion than normal but still great no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty even tempered no no Ah, that's pretty much every day. I feel really happy every day. I'm thankful. I'm grateful for my life and I'm just thankful for everything that comes into it. How are your best friends? very smart very loving very intelligent funny outgoing that's probably probably what my friends would say there's really nothing that I think I need to do or to have or to be different about myself like I'm okay with everything the way it is really am what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago what advice would I have given myself 10 or 20 years ago to know to understand that everything that happened 10 or 20 years ago was important in terms of developing the person that I am now. And so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Recently really enjoyed. Cooked a very wonderful meal because I love cooking. So that was something I really enjoyed. What are you most proud of in your life? Wow, my willingness to get to know myself through travel, through exploration, through practices, and through the practical application of everything that I've learned about people, cultures, places, and most importantly, you know, the God within me. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. She breathes, I see.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/455_P/455_AUDIO.wav,0
456,41,1," Okay. Okay, sure. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm well, thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? Boston, Massachusetts. Really? Yes. When did you move to L.A.? I moved to L.A. about a year after graduating college in 2001. How often do you go back to your hometown? Quite often, at least a couple times a year. How does it compare to a wedding? God, I love both cities. They are polar opposite in many, many ways, but there's things about both of them that I love. Why do you live for a wedding? To pursue acting and writing. How easy was it for you to get used to living in a wedding? It's still not complete reality to me, but it was actually very easy because of the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what I wanted to creatively, and it was different. The social culture was different in a way from where I had grown up, and it suited me better, my personality. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the fact that you can come here and pursue any niche of creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path. I grew up where it snows constantly and it's very, very cold. So it sounds obvious, but clearly I like that it's, you can swim year round and I like that it's, there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is. What I don't like, well, I miss my family. I miss that there's not, I don't like that there's not a big family element here. I miss, I'm a big family girl. I miss my family. I feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel sort of isolated alone here i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within California and around here. Just to have an adventure, do something fun or if I'm going home it means I'm gonna see my family. Well I like to drive up to Northern California, go to San Francisco, have family and friends there. Always super super fun and got in college with my a college boyfriend when I was in Boston we drove we went to San Francisco and drove down to LA and Las Vegas and that was kind of how I realized I wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one awesome what's one of your most memorable experiences in general just memorable experiences I guess it would be moving here I moved to when I moved to LA I got on a plane. I didn't know anybody here. And I just got, I talked to a girl that I met online and agreed to be her roommate. And she picked me up at the airport. We never met. And, you know, one of my dear friends to this day. So definitely the flight out here was, was big, monumental. I felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever. What did you study at school? I studied communications. I got lots of different writing styles. I eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and an English minor. What made you decide to do that? Writing. To pursue writing. What's your dream job? Writer. Well, I guess you could say writer slash actress, which is, but I guess writing is first. How hard is that? Hard. Very hard because you need to, no one's going to push you to do it. You have to be a self-starter. You have to make it happen. So it's very hard because I don't possess that naturally in my personality. I do, but not as much as I need to. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I would say outgoing in general. I sometimes take a walk if I feel tense um listen ambient music helps if I need a soothing background white noise calming calming area and just just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to come back to a calm, neutral place. I am getting better. I am good at controlling my temper because I don't usually have a temper too often, but when I do and I lose my cool, I have a hard time controlling it. Yes. No. okay what was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about argued with someone um god i guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend it it wasn't it was about uh our our each separate perspectives on a certain situation between us that were obviously very very different. And it started out as something big. And then we just realized this is, this is stupid. We don't need to be fighting about this. So it kind of ended quickly. I guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend, fighting with an ex-boyfriend, relationship stuff, definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be. I wish that I had just walked away from it. I don't know if I could have avoided the complete situation, but I definitely could have made the outcome much less chaotic. I guess that would be walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life but that I really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where I have to say I'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for sort of, you know, short-term pain for long-term gain. And I had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise, but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that, you know, you're not always going to feel great. Every decision is not always going to be easy and feel good. Yes. I was kind of forced to. The situation was just what was going on in life was sort of, You can't ignore those signs. Just, yeah. I guess it would be a particular argument I had with somebody that happened to be in sort of a public place and got in trouble for it. I wish I could erase that. What is your relationship with your family? That's so good to hear. Who is someone that has been a positive influence in your life? of both of them. It's pretty easy. I try. Lately, it's been a little bit hard. My sleep's been off, but for the most part, I've come to recognize the importance of it and it's been pretty easy. A little edgy or fidgety, maybe a little bit out of it. I might seem like I'm in a good mood because I might be a little giddy and laughing more, just sort of high emotions. But overall, get irritated faster and just sweat more, just feel a little off. I've been feeling pretty good lately. Not really, just trying to be more focused. get things done. I'm just trying to focus on what I want to do career wise and really stop wasting time or, you know, just procrastinating and get things done and being inspired, going and seeing, you know, being around people that are doing what I want to do and just carrying it over to my own life. No. No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Oh, just a couple days. I was just in with my family and my baby niece in Florida, and that's why I went down there to see her. So it was just awesome. I'm always happy when I see her. How do your best friends describe you? Probably as very funny. Humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say. joking always a little wise ass and my personality but um they would describe me as always unconditional there for them and just they know they know that i'm there if they need them always my drive being more driven and getting things done I guess it would be well a recent a recent ex-boyfriend that was a mistake of a relationship uh yeah sort of just the I think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel that the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that I'm even with this person made me feel like I'm allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so I'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible yes I regret not listening to my gut instincts don't second guess yourself say are some of your best qualities? Great listener, constant sense of humor, very malleable in terms of people, tolerant and comfortable around all, just people from just all ages, race, gender, whatever. I just, I crave diversity and love to just, you know, I just, I am a people person and I start every day with a blank slate. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I did some acting work on a series with a really great group of people and it was a very cool creative experience. Very inspiring. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? probably coming out to LA on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what I want to do thank you goodbye Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/456_P/456_AUDIO.wav,0
457,18,1," Fair enough. Yes. Spectacular. This is an interesting experiment. Awesome. Where are you from originally? I am from middle of nowhere, Iowa. Really? When did you move to LA? May 2nd of 2007. So exactly five years, six years ago. Um, and frequently, like once every couple of years. Okay. How does it compare to LA? Uh, the weather exists so it's more extreme. And then it's rather less exciting. A lot less colorful. Why do you live in LA? Uh, winter in Minnesota. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It took approximately the drive in. That's about all it took. The lights took care of the rest. What are some things you really like about LA? I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at night time so that bicycles have free reign of the streets. I like all the art. I love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here. What are some things you don't really like about the library? Oh, you know, the traffic, the exceedingly high cost of living. uh... yeah those are those are my big beefs uh... not nearly as much as i would like to i've done a little bit uh... i like not knowing exactly how things are going to go like the fact that it forces me to deal with people to deal with situations in ways that I normally wouldn't have to. Last year, I got to hang out in San Marcos for a little bit after I split up with my ex. And then after San Marcos, I went back to Iowa for a bunch of family stuff. And then I brought my little brother to Los Angeles. What's one of your most memorable experiences? He was all over the place, but the rest of us as his support group riding around on tall bikes and stuff, we didn't bat an eye. We didn't blink because this is normal for our friends. That wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately. It was just a happy, normal Sunday. But our group of friends is so unusual that a normal Sunday for us is extreme for everyone else. I used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you Los Angeles um um once I found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it it drew me to be social, extroverted even, outgoing, bombastic for the first time, and it stuck. If I weren't already the most relaxed guy already, I would probably do things, but when i'm really stressed out uh... uh... do all sorts of stuff uh... usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do not uh... what temper uh... How did you feel about him? That sounds really hard. uh hard on him i mostly uh mostly got by with a couple of scrapes on my ego okay tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently uh when when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day. And so instead of having my verbal gloves up, I managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can. It was not my most graceful moment. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about lots of stuff. I feel guilty about eating more often than anything else. Because I really love junk food. It's really good. And I have very little food willpower. Because I used to be a fat guy. I'm not sure what the hardest decision I ever had to make was I made a lot of hard decisions I guess it was pretty hard to leave Los Angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but it wasn't even that hard because it pushed me to do it so it's a tricky question madam oh you know broke collarbone severe pain get surgery on it all seemed like it made sense at the time Tell me about Neve or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. outside waiting for me. My mom is crazy, my dad is crazy, everyone else is crazy, I'm pretty crazy, but since most of the rest of them live so far away, I don't really have to deal with them too much. Relationship is positive and sparse. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Can you tell me about that? actually works on the exact things that make me excited. There's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance, and then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time. All of those things are really nice, but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return. I don't know, that's smitten. How do you know them? What a funny question. How do I know them? as though she's multiple people. How did you know? I know her through my bicycle friends. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? The hard part is going to bed, but as soon as I get to sleep land, I'm pretty much there until an earthquake hits. So I get to sleep poorly, but then I'm a pro at it, so it doesn't matter. Less verbose, and that's about it. My dark circles get slightly larger, and I'm pretty much the exact same dude because I've been doing it most of my life. So stoked that I might as well be on fire. because the universe in its infinite I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Arthur C. Clarke sense. So as a fortunate and vaguely aware being, it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yeah, my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate, and I'm feeling more and more inspired all the time. If I could just work on the motivation, I'd be set. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Since you asked me on the forum a little while ago, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. think I had it, but who knows at this point. That was a while ago. Can you tell me about that? I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time, and then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun, and then that's, you know, the rest is ancient history. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, 2013. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Uh, working on my shoes this morning was really nice. Doodling, uh, an art project that all my friends helped input on. That's, that was pretty nice, that's a nice feeling. awesome how do your best friends describe you? ahhhh that's a very good question, I'm not actually sure I'll ask him later today though what would you say are some of your best colleagues? um I guess I'm enthusiastic. I am thesauric. And I am I'm going to have to say highly analytical. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? It would be nice if I could get my superpowers back. That would be pretty cool. Like what? Like turning on some of the fancier, finely tuned and delicate machinery that Chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself. What are you most proud of in your life? Uh, that's a really tough one. I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be... I'm not actually sure. sure. Oh, all sorts of stuff, but I'm working on that. Don't masturbate so much. uh jackrabbit really bad puns uh and dessert no problem bye Ellie Okay What a hoot",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/457_P/457_P/457_AUDIO.wav,0
458,21,1," So you guys are controlling the virtual human. Okay. Yes. I'm doing fine, thank you. I'm from Los Angeles, California, yeah. Well, the main thing, I like the weather. I like the lifestyle. I like the variety of beach, snow. We have it all. What are some things you don't like about LA? Some things I don't like about LA? The rent is way, way, way, way too expensive. It's ridiculous. Have you traveled a lot? I have. I'm well-traveled. I enjoy seeing new places, going new places. It's different everywhere. People are different. It's fun. um okay well the most recent is last year i went to family reunion in new orleans so that was in june and um while i was there we also visited slydale louisiana for the um the swamp tours and Vicksburg, Mississippi, where my mom is from, and we spent the night in Faraday, Louisiana, with my aunt, who will be 101 this year in May. There's a lot as far as traveling or just period. most memorable experience well I don't know if it's just one probably when I used to travel with my dad that's where I got a lot of my traveling from um yeah it was bus car sometimes planes mostly what just I guess I'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips just general and also drama well my dream job is to become a real estate investor Well, I've sort of really been into it ever since 2005. I just don't have the capital right now or the connections. But since I do like real estate, I'm just going to start off as a real estate agent. So I should have my license sometime this year. Outgoing. Well, I'm not shy. It could be a little bit of both, but I'm pretty outgoing. Well, speaking of Hawaii, I did live there for a year and a half, but what do I do to relax is either usually take a nap, take a bath, or just try to get things off of my mine and try to spend my energy in more positive ways. It needs to be worked on, but I know when to control it when I need to. um well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um is this just over a text message but um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but that's usually how it goes um well I don't know what else to do except for prey on it because I thought once I moved into another house it would be over but I see that we're still getting into it so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess um probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um situation I wish I would have handled differently. Just kind of everything in my life almost. I could have done it differently, or I would if I had the chance, but I'm not worried about it because I don't regret anything that I've done in my life. The hardest decision? Um, probably when I had to get a divorce. That may have been the hardest of one of the hardest decisions. um it was just a lot of um a lot of stuff through the years um the relationship had kind of deteriorated um if the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing I would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because I would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so um i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but you know he didn't want to cooperate so um well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yeah um something i can erase um i don't think i really need to erase anything um i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that I can't think of anything to erase um it's fair slash good there's no problems right now so I guess I'll just say good yeah there's no problems um well I would have to say my mother yes um well she's just always supported me and everything that I've done um whether it's it's good or not so good so um I think that's a blessing um sometimes sometimes it's not um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is is i would like to um sometimes so um that's more the problem i would like to get Mm-hmm. I'm just sleepy. Yeah, sleepy, tired, feeling like I want to go take a nap. Um, I've been feeling fine. Uh, no, they've been about the same. No. No. No. Really happy? Probably last week because I got over to a little bit of money. so um well I guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that I've been knowing since 96 I really wouldn't I'm not going to say I don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom Well, right now I spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in. But maybe after the classwork is out of the way, maybe I could do something else. What are some things you would like to continue to do? When was the last time you felt like you were nothing? I would say that I'm genuine, I'm honest, I'm supportive, and I'm just a good friend. No. um well uh 20 years ago um just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain 80 pounds when the baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose um also if i came into any money now 20 years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it um so yeah i think that's about it um proud of uh i guess maybe myself um my kids okay thank you bye Mm-hmm.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/458_P/458_AUDIO.wav,1
459,48,2," Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. So, how are you doing today? I'm alright, a little tired. Okay. Where are you from originally? I live in Culver City. Originally I was, I grew up in Venice. What are some things you really like about LA? The beach, fast drivers, the city. I've lived in Utah, I don't really like anything else but the city. anything else but the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know many people who live here anymore. Traffic. It's too big. But it's home. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I've been out of the country a few times. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing new places. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. When I was 14, I went to Costa Rica to visit my father. And I was there for two weeks, and that was the last time I've been there. Nice! What's one of your most memorable experiences? In Costa Rica? Yeah. Um, seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker. How did you feel in that moment? Um, joy. I was happy, excited, kind of scared. What made you decide to do that? It wasn't my decision, it was my mom's. She had planned the trip. Are you happy you did that? Yeah. That's good. What did you study at school? I wanted to be an art major, but I didn't understand why I was in math classes among other classes. And I thought I was wasting my time, so I decided I really didn't want to do that. So I moved back to L.A. Okay. What's your dream job? I don't really have a dream job. I would like to be self-employed though. Can you tell me about that? Right now I'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer, but I'm not really sure. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Around new people I'm very reserved, but the people I do know I'm a lot more outgoing and talkative. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Um, to relax... I go on walks. I walk my dog a lot. I call my girlfriend if I want to calm down. I also do meditation and self-hypnosis. I try. How hard is that? It depends on how I'm feeling or how upset I am or how calm I'm trying to be. Can you tell me about that? If I'm really upset, it's a lot harder for me to calm down and bring myself down through meditation or through self-hypnosis. I see what you mean. Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm alright at it. Sometimes I lose it. I yell when I lose my temper and I have put holes in walls. Not yet. Last night me and my mom got in an argument. It was about me buying a ticket last night for a Greyhound to go to Utah. What made you decide to do that? I'm going up there to work for a few weeks and make a little bit of money and I need you to buy my ticket a week in advance and I didn't want to do it last night. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. that situation last night. I wish I had not blown up or gotten as enraged as I can over the situation because it escalated. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My little sister I'm very close with. She's 15 years old. She's about to turn 16 in a few days. I would do anything for her. She is the world to me. My mom, we fight, we push each other's buttons. I believe she views me as my father. She believes that I will not succeed at anything. How did you feel in that moment? Sad. I'm sorry. It's okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I wish I could forget most of my high school years or my sophomore year. Why? I just didn't like high school or my sophomore year. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I'm getting sober and going to a drug rehab. Can you tell me about that? When I was 16 I got, I started doing a few different drugs and it got out of hand I guess and my mom was trying to get me help and I didn't want the help so I kept escaping to different places and running away and not wanting to be in the places so I finally agreed to go to Utah and try and get sober. I see. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Tell me more about that. Um, he's been my best friend my entire life, ever since I can remember, and we grew up together. He used to use drugs with me, and he's been sober for more than a year now. That's great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Almost impossible. Why? I either have to have no sleep the night before to get a few hours, or I just don't sleep well and I'm against taking pills. and I stopped smoking marijuana and so now I just I don't sleep or haven't been for the past few weeks. Yeah it's not fun. I lay in bed until I finally fall asleep in the early morning or I watch TV until late at night or Netflix. I'm out of it, I'm tired, I'm groggy. I'm a lot more likely to, my anger is a lot more likely to come out. I've been alright this weekend. It has been better than most. My girlfriend has stayed at my place the entire weekend so I've been happy. I don't... I'm not as irritable. No. But... Yes. I was probably, I was, I believe I was 12 the first time I was diagnosed. I've been diagnosed multiple times, though. Most recent time being less than a year ago. What got you to seek help? My mom sought help for me. She saw that I was unhappy, and she became worried. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? I stopped on June 1st when I graduated my drug rehab program in Utah last year. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? I've learned coping skills, so I'm able to calm myself down when I'm angry easier. I know how to stay away from my trigger points and staying away from being angry. Or becoming depressed. It can be. If the person is willing to change. And wanting it. I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Two days ago. Can you tell me about that? it was because I was with my girlfriend, we were having a moment, and so I was just overwhelmed by the happiness, I guess. That's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you? Trustworthy, funny, shit, I don't know. Going smart, athletic, he would, yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I wasn't, I was so short-fused. I wish I wasn't depressed. I wish I didn't feel like I needed something to help me sleep. I wish I was just completely dependable on myself. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. When I was younger, my father would, he once hit my dog in front of me because he was mad at me. So he started hitting the dog and I don't know, that was probably the biggest thing. When I was little, I remember just being sad. Yeah. Everyone has something they regret. Not to be so naive. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I went to hypnosis. I had an appointment for hypnosis a few days ago. Tell me more about that. It was really relaxing, really calming, and I feel like it could help me. What made you decide to do that? One of my mom's colleagues referred her to a psychiatrist who was really good with ADHD and patients like that. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm athletic. I'm nice. I like to... I put other people before myself. Most of the time, I don't know if that's a negative quality or a positive. I... I don't know. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend, I would either go to a few parties or I'll hang out with my girlfriend. out in Fullerton or I'll be in Los Angeles or the beach. What are you most proud of in your life? I haven't really felt like I've accomplished anything to be adequately proud of, but I did very well in sports in high school when that's really it. Okay. Bye.

That would be my dream job. So I'm excited that, like, I want to go in a direction that I want to go in. And yeah, tb is to work with sort of getting kids on a more organic, universal trajectory. How hard is that? I think it could be done. I don't think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there. I mean, that always ends up becoming, you know, facade and farce itself anyway. But I think there are ways. I've always reached kids anyway, and they've always felt where I was coming from. And so I think, you know, there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess I'm just a combination of the two. I don't think, I don't know. Actually, I might even be working that out. There might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa, so you don't know. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Yeah, that's cool. What do you do to relax? I definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible. So a lot of lying down at the moment. I'm in transition, so there's just a lot of, and I hang out with my dogs a lot. So that's quite soothing. I try not to do, I don't really do anything that's too tense unless it's time for it, like time to drive to a job or time to, you know, go make some things happen, meetings and stuff. But otherwise, I try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time, so it's not like break. But, you know, I miss swimming. I can't believe summer's coming, so I'm going to swim some more too. How are you at controlling your temper? When I'm truly outraged, it comes out. And then I'm hitting some kind of bad parts right now because it's a very hard time I'm fighting for my child. So there are times when I will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam. Has that gotten you in trouble? A little bit, but usually pretty much there's always, you know, someone in the periphery that gets it. And, you know, it's like that bumper sticker. If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. So usually some kind of sanity can prevail. When was the last time you argued with someone? Oh, well, I mean, these are also times where I just can't find something in the car. But when I argue with people, it's been a lot of the times when I'm being flat out, you know, sabotaged or definitely just... When... What's the last specific time? Well, I... You know, I lost my temper dreadfully with, unfortunately, the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of... I mean, she's pretty much a horrible person. So I recently lost my temper with her. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like, I mean, again, I think I sort of said this just now. I felt, in a way, good because I get it, you know, which is as opposed to not getting it, which is even worse. but I guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to, to where you can be a little more constructive about it. It's like, you know, you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on, but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty. But, I mean, I didn't feel like shame. I really honestly didn't feel shame. I didn't feel... There are times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you, that's all. But I never really feel bad for being angry about what I'm angry about. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, when I was pregnant, I wish I had, like I said, I went through such an awakening about realizing when I was being sort of undermined that demanding my respect became a huge issue. And when I was pregnant, I ended up being so disrespected in the place because I was being a hippie on the beach for six years. So I felt like I was being so disrespected in the place where I was set to be when the child arrived that I stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid. So, yeah. It's fucked up. Yeah. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't want to erase anything from my memory. I like having everything consolidated and cohesive and integrated. I don't want to erase anything. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, did I get it right or did I get it wrong? Yeah, I guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign sign mediation agreement with DCFS and I should have said no let's just go straight to court because that there is nothing wrong with me I just happened to succumb to an SSI check via bullshit with my mother's and I should have just been you know brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead I chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out over cautiousness it's horrific horrendous Borgia quality intrigue and sabotage it's bad that's okay someone that I mean there's been you know there's been some some great people again from afar I have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships and I'm working through that right right right now and I think that's a lot why I don't have my son but as I've grown and developed I've seen encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to get to that point not so easy these days at all I'm being I've been I'm not completely centered and then there's been some actual you know people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that I'm still pretty Pollyanna'd out I still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible How have you been feeling lately? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. During the day, I'll think something completely true and organic, and I'll just stare at something and go, wow, that's beautiful, and I'll be reminded that I'm pretty close to my spirit. So I try to stay there 24-7. I'm pretty spiritual that way. How are your best friends around you? I mean, if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me, it gets pretty competitive out there. that I'm, this is off, you guys, that I'm funny and that, and that, I think that's bad, that I'm funny and that I'm good and that I'm trustworthy. Just, I'm not necessarily change, but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with and disconnect from the people that manage to drain me. Is there anything you regret? I already said I regret the thing with leaving the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was being sort of abused. Right. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Get the fuck away from your mother. Sorry. You know, and like a lot of, and, yeah, and to open your eyes. Look what's going on. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud of my spirit and my outlook and my my access to what's really going on in the world and my awakeness I'm just proud of me as a person okay you welcome bye right on this came off okay it's the old thing yeah it's the old test it's the other one like sort of two questions ago",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/461_P/461_AUDIO.wav,2
463,17,1," All right. So she'll start up in just a few seconds on her own, and then again when she's done, press this button and I'll come back in. Okay, cool. All right, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes, I am. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I am pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in Los Angeles, California. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the fact that everything is close by, all the stores, the shops. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Um, the traffic. I've traveled, but not too much. What do you enjoy about traveling? Going away from your usual days, exploring new sites. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Three weeks, no, a month ago I went to Las Vegas with me and my friends and we just went sightseeing. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? In Las Vegas, we went to the Hoover Dam and it was breathtaking. It was really big and we saw the big canyon and it was impressive. I've never seen something like that before. That's great. What did you study at school? I studied nursing. Are you still working in that? I graduated two months ago, so I took my board exam to be licensed and I passed, so I'm just waiting for my license in the mail. That's so good to hear. What's your dream job? My dream job is to be a registered nurse. What made you decide to do that? A long time ago when I was a little boy, I got injured, and my parents had to take me to the hospital. And the doctors came by, and they had to stitch me up on the leg. And I saw all of that, and that made me want to pursue the medical field. Wow. Are you happy with that? Yes, I am very happy. That's good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family is okay, not good, not bad. It's in between. How close are you to your family? I am close. I am very close to them. If I have a problem, I go to them for help. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school. That's a long time. Yes. Can you tell me about that? Yes. We've known each other since we were in the third grade, and we've gone to elementary, middle school, and high school together, and he lives like two blocks away, so he's basically like a brother of mine. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I am shy. Why? um i really don't know i've i've always been a quiet person um ever since i can remember sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax hmm what do i do i i go into my room i turn my ac on and i just relax in my bed i am pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? How did you feel in that moment? Why? Because my manager, he wanted me to do something faster than what I usually can handle. And he already knew that my workload was a lot, but he didn't understand that, so that made me just very sad. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I cannot remember one. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I ever had to make was dropping out of school. I felt that I didn't really belong far away from home and so I was just thinking ahead. I was in a major that I didn't really like and so I decided to just not go next semester and go back home to LA. Are you happy you did that? Right now that I'm looking at it, yes. I am very happy that I did that because I wouldn't have gone to nursing school and I wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now. That makes sense. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't have an event. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It depends on the days where I work or where I don't work. Can you tell me about that? Yes. Right now I work at a retail store early in the morning. I go at 3 in the morning and I get out at 10am. So it's really hard for me to get a good night's sleep. What are you like when you don't sleep well? When I don't sleep well, I can be a little bit grumpy, irritated, or just frustrated with the situation. I understand. How have you been feeling lately? Lately I've been okay. I've been good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I have not. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I was really, really happy and excited was when I found out that I passed my license board exam to be a nurse. Awesome! How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would describe me as a caring, nice, sweet, shy, quiet guy. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Why? Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. I don't have one. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No, I don't. What's something you feel guilty about? This one time, I... at my work, it's a retail store, I kinda took some merchandise without buying it. it. It was a risk that I took, but since no one was around and the opportunity was right there for me to get it I just got it and I took it home I don't know Yes, last weekend I went yard selling with my family and it was pretty fun going out to different yard sales and finding random stuff. Nice! Like what? I bought this big black bean bag. It was huge and it was only for $2 and so I got it and now it's in my room and I sit on it. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I am most proud of is the fact that I am a nurse that I am a nurse I'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that I would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and call and nursing homes Bye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/463_P/463_AUDIO.wav,0
464,30,1," All right. All right, cool. Thank you. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. What about you? I'm good. I'm great. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, but I currently reside in Englewood. Wait, did I answer your question? I don't know. Yeah. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? LA? Okay. The murals. the ocean what else the people my family's over here so that's the best part what about you oh wait yeah um i would say the smog yeah the air it could be cleaner and yeah um that's i mean there's good people and bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good. Yeah, I've been to Mexico and the temples in Northern California, so yes. Traveling, like, cleaner air, that's good, it's healthier for the body, cleaner blood flow, the people, culture, and stories, and when you come back, you can share stories with, like, your friends, yeah um anytime like right now or when okay so like this one time when i was a kid we went out to the temples and um it started raining so we just started walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go does the smaller the steps get. So like people back then had smaller feet. So what happened was as I went higher towards the temple, I had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the steps. But once you get up there, it's a nice view. Awesome. Yeah. What did you study at school? General education, but mainly art. Yeah, I took a lot of art classes. What made you decide to do that? Um, well, when I was a kid, I used to scribble on walls with Crayola, so I figured, you know, like, it kind of stuck around with me, so I just pursued it. So, yeah. What's your dream job? My dream job would be to get paid for painting. Painting art. Yeah. Um, yeah. Pretty simple. It's not so much that it's hard. It just requires passion, persistence, and faith and will. You just have to really believe in yourself. The more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are able to succeed. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I consider myself to be shy in certain times and places, but I am also outgoing when I have the energy. so I feel like it's well balanced you know like I'm shy when it's I guess okay to be shy you know and I'm outgoing when like the need to actually um have fun or just explore feels good like if that makes sense but yeah yeah to relax either well I don't know if I should say this but I smoke weed so that helps and I like painting painting pretty much helps me relax you know especially when I use a color blue because a color blue relaxes me and also green when I use these two colors and make a painting it calms me down. And you have a blue shirt. My temper? Well, my thoughts. My thoughts control my emotions. And my emotions, yeah, that's pretty much how my temper is. I try to make sense. Is it worth getting mad? Or if I do get mad, what would be the outcome? So controlling my temper is just by training my thought. um the last time i argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like nope so that kind of frustrated me and the way i handled it was like well i could just eat when I come back, and I'm doing him a favor, so, you know, and then after, you know, I could just eat in peace, so, yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My family, it's pretty good. My mom and dad have a good relationship, still married, and my brothers and sisters, we help one another out, so that's good. It's just, yeah, it's like a team. A situation I wish I could handle differently would be... Hmm. That's a good question. I mean, can I get a scenario? Okay. Situation I could handle differently... Well, see, that's the thing. I feel like if I'm calm in any situation, I can figure it out. You know? But if it came down to like a Rubik's Cube, maybe, how would I handle that situation would be just by failing, making mistakes. Because if I make the right mistakes, then the right lessons will come after. So, that's the best way I could answer your question. You know? Yeah. Who's side has been a positive influence in your life? A positive influence? pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know like yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean they're actually good influences so i would say my friends uh my mom my dad my brother my sisters yeah well see that's the thing like like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like to sense things out and also how to avoid situations, so even though it was bad, and it did kind of, like, scar me, it did prepare me for, like, the world, you know, because this happened to me when I was, like, 12, 13 years old, so I was already being exposed to, like, you know, like, guns, knives, and all that stuff, so it's, it's bad, but it's good in the long term, you know, because if you get out of that slump, it's, like, nothing else would really phase you, because, oh, you think in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know and so yeah the hardest um man this one right now see like the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing life-changing whether to continue school college or not and i kind of chose to like i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i want to be in so that was a hard choice because there was no um guarantee that i would like run into like the right people but i took that chance and you know I met the right people so yeah yeah yeah um actually really easy I sometimes yeah like if I wanted to I could sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know I could just like shut down my mind like just calm down like like slow down my air pattern yeah lately i've been feeling good i've been feeling like i have free will like at this point in time i feel like if i chose a path any path with like my heart i could get there you know but i'm kind of like still deciding it's like everything in all these paths are in the air or should i make my own, I don't know, that's where I'm at, I feel like I have free will, so yeah. That's great, how do you understand the changes in your behavior and confidence? Whatever comes to mind. For example, right now, it just happened. Huh? For right now, like, this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought. Because, yeah, it's like, it's technology, you know? It's like, it's a trip to see how far, like, one could take a thought and then make it reality. So that's kind of like shifting my thoughts right now. This experience, this whole experience. Yeah. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with a stress disorder? Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? Can you tell me about that? Being a fish who can't swim in the water. Feeling depression is like being a bird without wings. Pretty much, it feels like you're limited. But then the thing is, to get out of that depression, it's like you have to awaken and change your perspective and focus on, like, I would say colors. Colors help. And people. Talking to people helps. Yeah. When is the last time you were depressed? Being depressed? let's see, I don't know, like, it could come, like, it could happen every day, like, it's small doses, doses, so, like, I could say today, you know, earlier, when I was just by myself, I felt a little depressed, but then what happened, I fixed it, like, I caught up a friend, and met up with him, and yeah. um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know i'm talking to a virtual person that's pretty cool and yeah right now i feel happy um sometimes hard-headed like he would try to teach me um a certain lesson whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he would probably just describe me as like like like he would listen but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do so pretty much like i don't know yeah i mean that's what he tells me but yeah overall good person What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Probably just exercise, my diet, food, my food intake, and yeah, just exercise. Pretty much it. How would you make a difference or value about yourself? I would say when I was like in middle school or in elementary a little bit of high school too but what it would yeah what it would be was it would either be about um well pretty much my art like if I read did something and I thought it was good and then someone else be like oh you know that looks kind of like like trash and then I'll be like oh damn either I could accept it and be like yeah it does kind of look and then fix it or what i would do back then would be like damn you know just kind of dwell on that thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it but yeah usually it's um people's words and ideas that yeah yeah that's what i said regret um yeah i got a couple things i regret like what well sometimes i feel like i should have completed the whole university thing but i mean at the same time i feel like if i really wanted to go i would have gone so yeah that's kind of a regret in my head 10 or 20 years ago would be um seek spiritual well-being you know learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i will teach myself um pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment uh certain events you will experience and as far as your overall happiness yeah among other things but yeah well i'm most proud of right now is my paintings yeah i'm proud of that because like i feel like these paintings i'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind and like it's it's there you know it has its own signature so so yeah i'm pretty happy about that. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Thank you. All right. Bye. Hmm.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/464_P/464_AUDIO.wav,1
465,22,1," Okay. Yeah. Cool. So, how are you doing today? That's good. Where are you from originally? Really? What are some things you really like about LA? All the different microcosms and different places and peoples and scenes and stuff. You know, it's very big, very vast. It's crazy. I don't know. I can't, I mean, of course there's a bunch of things I could say, but I don't know. I mean, I like L.A. I like even the bad, you know. It's just all a part of the experience in general, you know. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, I've been around the country a bunch. What do you enjoy about traveling? Again, it's like going into another world. It's like Quantum Leap. I get to transport into a whole other realm of people and learn about them and stuff and hang out and drink beer and smoke weed and write and rap and do drugs and hang out more and all sorts of shit, man. it's crazy. Oh, really? Oh, okay. You know, I went to San Francisco recently, and I was there for like eight days. I wrapped up this house party in San Jose real quick. Then I went to Davis, did the same thing. I took the train, chilled in San Francisco, hung out with some of my middle school friends for hella long. And then, yeah, it was crazy. I was just walking. Usually I ride bikes everywhere, but I was just, like, walking this whole time. And it was cool. I was mad exploring. I got back home eventually. Then after that, I went directly to Texas and did some shows on the way going to Texas and stayed out there for eight days. And it was gnarly. It was crazy. I don't even know, man. It was so much happening. You know, I had fun. I went to this place called the Salton Sea and me a bunch of my bicycle friends we um we got in the cars on the way out into the desert and we um yeah it was tight we were burning stuff we burned the car we drove the car it was like a road warrior type of car and um it was crazy man Like it was like 15 niggas on one car It was like gnarly We got naked Went and do a stream I did hella shrooms Did hella molly Smoked ridiculous amounts of weed Got retarded drunk Somebody tried to give me some meskin I didn't want to do that But this was like in March Before I went on the other trip This was like the precursor To my other trip It was the Salt and Sea trip But it was tight I saw a lot of nakedness that trip Yeah, really.

Smoke weed. what did i study uh um oh i was um photography and photojournalism and uh yeah yeah that's about it got to use a computer for free gotta get use baller ass cameras for free and i would just do a little uh i would do man on the street type shit with students not man on the street but the ones where you take their picture and it's like i forgot what it was called it was long ago are you still working on that nah nah nah not anymore this being me and she hanging out i rap that's what i do i do little shows around the country and stuff i got a little fan base and i'm just always you know just doing that just doing art I draw too. My dream job is not working a job and being me. That's the dream job, getting paid for being me. So, yeah. I'm pretty good. Like two weeks ago, that is after hours. One, I was already like super drunk. And two was after hours. Three was after hours. So, like, man, I had a bunch of pens. And these dudes took my pins away, pins in my, like, fanny pack. I have, like, a fanny pack, so I had pins in there because I do art. He's like, nah, dog, you can't take this in there. I'm like, okay, for sure. Let me just leave them right here when I get them when I come out. He's like, okay. I come out, and they're gone. I accidentally knock a beer over, and he gets mad at me. He's like, you got to go now. And I'm like, that wasn't my fault. That was your fault. But then while that happened, my homie was getting, like, ambushed by these three big old security guards. And then, you know, when I saw them put hands on my friend, That's when I really lost it. And I was like, man, let go of my friend right now. And he's like, what you going to do? I'm like, what you going to do? And then, like, he threw me to the ground. No, no. He had his arm over me. I put my arm over him and threw him to the ground. And then it got broken up. But that was the last time I got angry. It was cool. It was fun. Life, you know. maybe that maybe that situation could have been handled differently it could have been handled differently if they would have been handling things differently then i wouldn't have to react it's not like i was mad i was acting off a reaction i had to act like that because like justice like I couldn't it was unjust it was like I'm not a Mean person at all but when I saw one of my loved ones get attacked I had to like come and like you know like react to that and They were that hot and I mean I was like yo y'all niggas is trippin like yo Chill out is the tiny little white dude. You're humongous as Mexican niggas. I you need to fall back.

The hardest? I guess I don't really know what the hardest decision was, but I get faced with hard decisions, and those would be like, I got so many friends, sometimes I can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend. So it's like I gotta make decisions Like if I go over to this sector of the town I'm gonna hang out with XYZ niggas If I go over here, XYZ niggas So it's like You know Those are hard decisions Because I never like to let anybody down So yeah, stuff like that Deciding between friends to hang out with Ouch Tell me about your relationship with your family It's cool, I live with my mom What's that relationship with your family?

I don't know. something I could erase from my memory I wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory because that'd be like because like the experiences you go through make you who you who you are I think weak people like to want to erase things or block things out like I don't know That doesn't exist I mean there's shit That's been hard But I would never say I would not want that to happen Cause you know You must You gotta learn from the experience You know I mean to be the better you All that shit is like It's like a test You know That bad experience Is just a test And you gotta overcome And be stronger And not just like Curl up and be like Oh my god Life's hard Oh You know That shit's for weak people I don't believe in that I have compassion for people Who do get Who do wanna do stuff like that but I still, like, I don't see the logic in it. How easy is it for you to get in the sleep? I mean, I stay up pretty late and do all sorts of reckless-ass shit. But when I am home, it's pretty easy. I could just go to sleep. You know, when I get tired, I get tired. How have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've been on this, like, I've been partying hella tough lately, like, oh, my God, for at least six days. Like today Coming to do this To talk to you Was the first time I've been able to come back To Culver City Since like Friday Cause I've been downtown And it was like Single to Mayo And it was like You know Random ass parties I went to with homies Smoking ridiculous amounts Of cigarettes Drinking beers Fucking did some molly Fucking did some coke Fucking Shit was crazy yo It was just like It was a rockstar weekend Or a week or type of stuff. That's post-traumatic stress syndrome? No, I have not. I have not. But I get... Oh, I mean, shoot. Saturday, I was hella happy. It was great. But I was under the influence, so... But it was still great, you know? I was mad empathic, like mad like a flirty. I was freestyling like a G. I was like kicking hella rhymes. It was dope, you know, analyzing my life, realizing some stuff that I'm going to change about my life. And, yeah, I had a ball. It was great. It was awesome. Oh, yeah, it was. No, I didn't even have a crazy come down. I'm like, I'm chilling. I definitely gained a couple pounds from last week. I've been drinking a lot of beers. I'm feeling a little extra-ness. But besides that, I'm ready. Okay. I don't know. As a lovable dude, people be loving me, man. They don't like me. They love me. And that's just crazy. I just, you know, I just try to be happy. I try to make people happy and just, you know, be real posi-core, as they've said. Like, just hella positive, you know. Man, I really don't wish I could. I mean, I'd lose weight, I guess. That's about it. But besides that, I mean, I ride bikes every day. Like, my legs are pretty strong. Maybe I would just get more of a buff in the arm. But that's about the only thing I would change. And I'm not really in a hurry to change that. Like, if that happens, just through living and me biking more, then, yeah, cool. But I don't, I'm not, you know, abrupt change. I don't need, I mean, gradual change, sure. But I'm not, I don't know, yeah. I wouldn't change anything. But if I would, it would be that. But really nothing because I'm chilling right now. Tell me about a time when you said that maybe you were really proud of yourself. I don't know. I got broken up with, like, in August. That made me feel bad about myself, I guess. And, yeah, it was just somebody I was going out with, but they just broke up with me, and, like, that shit sucked. But that was probably the last time I felt really bad about myself. Can you tell me about that? What exactly do you want to know about that? What do you want to know? Oh, like, I don't know. We were just going out And then she was just Hella jealous And was going through my phone Sometimes And was accusing me of shit But then she ended up Breaking up with me Just cause she wanted to like Mess around with other people And that was the relationship In a nutshell Life sucks You gotta adapt and change man You know what I mean Don't walk from it Run to What did you say yeah that bitch gave me STD that shit sucks fucking hey that's the only thing I regret yeah man cold game but I got the shot it was cool I'm like boom clean that's about it I don't know she's a cool person we still hang out you know she keep losing I'm just gonna keep winning you know I mean don't run from it run to it you know I mean wait wait 10 or 20 years ago i was only seven years old what do i tell my seven-year-old self he wouldn't be able to comprehend the advice i would get what would you say oh oh oh yeah he wouldn't um be able to comprehend the advice i'd give him i'd be like just um fucking read a little more books or something dude like uh i don't know man fucking it's gonna be okay you're you're great just keep doing cool shit and have a ball i don't know i wouldn't know i wouldn't want to alter young me actually and this is why i say this because if i would tell my young self to do something differently i would not have grown into the person I am right now to even be able to tell my young self something. If the laws of quantum physics and all that shit is real and time travel, you know, anything I do in the past, this life would now be a variable. So me going back there, telling him to do something different will alter the course of history and then the time stream that I'm in may cease to exist. You know what I'm saying? So I really wouldn't want to do that. I would just be like, fuck up. fuck up more even, fuck, yeah, make more mistakes, because the only way to, to be a better person is to make hella mistakes, you know, at least that, at least that's, like, my, my reckless, like, mind state, like, yo, if you're gonna fuck up, fuck up hard, because you'll learn more from it, you know, let's say, what is it, um, experience is the best professor, you know what I'm saying, that's basically what, that's, that's how that jive, you know what I mean, I'm proud of this life that I'm here doing stuff like this I'm like so stoked. I've been around the country. I've been on people's albums. I write I do voiceover work from time to time Yeah, people know me I rap or ride bikes.

466,61,2," Oh, is that me? Do I talk? Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, is that okay? Okay, it's better. okay thanks okay thank you thank you Yes. Okay. Okay. Los Angeles. The weather. the variety of environments the ocean various different environmental variety I don't like the superficiality of people the narcissistic attitude And just the, it doesn't have a small town sort of feel where, you know, just the warmth, the human sort of warmth interactively. So, yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No. Why? I have a fear of flying and I have developed agoraphobia. How hard is that? Incredibly difficult. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying. It's more of a recent development and it's progressing to be worse. It's very, what's the word, immobilizing and very distressing actually. That sounds really hard. Yes, it is. How do you cope with that? How do I cope with that? Just trying to do the best I can and try to have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself in small steps. I read a lot. I do bibliotherapy reading, and I try to inform myself of the professional literature so that I could hopefully overcome it someday. That's good. Are you triggered by something? Yes, definitely. Like what? Certain things trigger it like enclosed spaces, being in a car, traveling, being away from home, being in someone else's car, things that are outside of my locus of control. What do you study at school? Um, actually I don't go to school right now. What's your dream job? Um, my dream job is to be a psychologist. Awesome. What made you decide to do that? Um, I'm not a psychologist, but what would make me decide to do that is, um, uh, And having lived through some challenges like this, having lived through some traumas, but I've always had an interest in it since junior high. I'm very interested in people and in human interaction and human connection and the betterment of those things. bridging people together and helping people enter personally through their personal challenges. So that's sort of it in a nutshell. Okay. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm someone who's I can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presence very easily but I think on the exterior but I think I'm shy and I challenge it to do that I think at heart I'm shy but I challenge myself completely because I do love human interaction so I take those risks and jump and those challenges the last time I interacted with somebody was today if I think I'm understanding your question correctly oh no no I think I'm misunderstanding your question but I I interacted with Rachel. I just, I'm continuously interacting with people, taking those risks. How are you at controlling your somebody? Very good. Very good. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it like? When was the last time I argued with somebody? I actually can't remember. It wasn't recent. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. I have to think about that. I don't know yet. Let me think. I'm drawing a blank. I can only remember things from when I was like 21 right now. I can't think of anything contemporary right now. My mind is... When you were young. Okay, when I was younger. Can you tell me about that? Yes, I lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins because when I was 21, I'm 45. I had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was critical of her and she threw me out of their home. and let me back. I apologized immediately, and they let me back into their lives and changed their minds. So I regret that. I'm assuming you mean, how did I feel when they asked me to never be in their lives again and to leave? shattered, soul shattered, heart shattered. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, that was my family. That was the good side of my family. There's the majority of my family. They were the loving aspect of my family. The rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive. How close are you to your family? I don't have any relationship with my family at all. Since I was 21, since my aunt and uncle disowned me, I guess is the right word. Estranged, yeah. Tell me about Mimosa or something that you or she Gosh, I'm drawing a blank. Just bear with me for one second. Something I could erase. I can't even get it to my memory. As an example, I was injured and I wish I could get that away from my memory. Yeah, I was injured in the emergency room. I went in for food poisoning. I was ordered to go in by a doctor. I had collapsed, and I was ordered to go into the ER for, as I said, food poisoning. And I came out injured with a neurological syndrome. I was injured with a, what do you call it, intravenous procedure. And now I have RSD, reflex sympathetic dystrophy. and the scene in the emergency room was an out-of-control scene. There was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake. And it was extremely excruciating. It was a crisis. And so every time I think about the injury and it was disfiguring, I got disabled. disabled, I got disabled for it, disabled permanently from it. I was also disabled from my employment for quite a given amount of time as well. And I have residual physical trauma from it and disfigurement and severe disability limited functionality with my right hand and arm. Thank you. I don't even know what that is. I you know I I really I apologize because I can't really probably give you the most suitable answer I'm guessing it had something to do with my cat and her urgent what do you call it hurt she was an intensive care veterinary care and I'm sure it had something to do with that But other than that, I would say I had choosing my life path, whether and I was admitted to that program or whether I was going to go to art school for four years. And I had to pick a life direction, but that's not a traumatic situation. so I don't know how best to answer your question I can't I have severe nightmares and I have I have nocturnal panic attacks. Are they triggered by something? And I also have physical illness on top of it, and I'm in excruciating pain. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Yes. Are they triggered by something? Yes. Can you tell me about that? Yes, they're triggered by the injury that I told you. They're triggered by my family, how they've treated me, what they've said to me, what they've done to me. They're triggered by, what else, my physical illness, not my injury only, but my physical illness as well. So yes. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I feel very ill and feel so fatigued. How have you been feeling lately? Very ill and very fatigued. Have you had a study to say that the regular and the post-traumatic? When I don't sleep and get enough sleep, my anxiety level, I believe, is up, and I'm susceptible to feeling distressed. So, yeah. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Three years ago, my most recent diagnosis, and in 2001 as well. Have you been diagnosed with depression? How long ago were you diagnosed? Three years ago and when I was 20 years old. What brought you to see the house? My background, my childhood from my family of origin and their, you know, the abuse that I went through and their ultimate, what's the word, rejection of me and estrangement. That was the first reason. Do you still go to therapy now? No, I stopped six months ago. Why did you stop? Why did I stop? I'm just taking a break. I'm going to continue. Yes, very much. It's helped tremendously. I think it helps with anxiety. It helps inspire, create inspiration. It helps feeling connected. It helps to create what I ultimately, my goal is to give myself a voice. and it helps to, it's part of that process. It also helps to understand myself, to learn about myself. And there's just so many benefits. I'll stop right there. There's many more. That's good. Mm-hmm. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy, it was a really long time ago. It was before my illness, and it was in 1997. The onset of my illness was in July of 1997, so it was before that. Can you tell me about that? Yes. I was in a very good place in terms of my career, in terms of just my relationships, and everything was just sort of at its best, career, relationships, personal fulfillment sort of as well. I was very active and doing very many things that were meaningful to build a life. And I was in the process of just in the planning stages of my life, but also very accomplished at the same time. So things were just going very well, and I just really liked just where my life was at. It was just in a really good place in many ways. I wish I could change about myself my anxiety I wish I could change about myself my agoraphobia my PTSD meaning my trauma and what else my insecurity as far as just with other people in the sense that I'm always trying to make sure that that I don't do something that hold on one second I'm just trying to make sure that I don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and I feel like I'm overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself. So I definitely think that that would be beneficial to change. The other thing I'd like to change about myself is I wish I could feel, and also depression, I'd like to change that about myself. I wish I could feel better. I wish I didn't feel so, So I wish I didn't have the burden that I do of my family, of not having one. And what else? I wish I didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that I'm in. So those are some things. And I also wish that, and this is a byproduct of PTSD, I wish that I didn't have the symptomology of PTSD, because that definitely affects one's complete life. It affects their life completely. And I wish I was more articulate, and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken and someone who was well-written. But there's many more things that I wish I could change about myself to improve myself. So, many more. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not sure. maybe to not be so trusting. I trusted some medical professionals that, you know, again, created the injury. And, you know, we're, there's a, what's the word? And there's an expectation and sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession. And don't ask questions and just sort of, you know. And not to trust your own self, your own instincts or intuition. And so I would have told myself to be a little more careful, I guess, if that's useful to your question. Tell me about something you didn't really enjoy. What did I really enjoy? Okay. you know I can't think of anything specific but I know it would have to do with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level I'm most proud of my compassion my empathy and caring about people despite I mean I'm proud of it anyways but also particularly I come from an environment that's the opposite, a background, and I wasn't taught that. But I really do care about people, and I guess I'm most proud of that. I'm also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity, my fierce tenacity to succeed. and you know just also to get the strength it takes to get through the injury to live with it and to live with the illness that I live with the physical illness so I think that would be it yes okay You're welcome. Bye. Bye. Okay. I've been crying and opening up to this person. So I think I did what you wanted, right? I'm embarrassed because I like got really sort of involved like she was asking questions that you know were really at the heart of you know some of your pain you know and I was honest about it so yes it's embarrassing I'm sure the video is like oh my gosh you know like this person like I'm sure this is what you're hoping that someone can genuinely interact right with someone okay cool oh okay okay oh thank you yeah I didn't know I'd need",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/466_P/466_AUDIO.wav,2
467,18,1," All right. So just press this button and she says bye now. All right. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, I'm okay with it. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I feel pretty good. A little nervous. Why? Because I've never done anything like this before. That's why. Okay. Where are you from originally? From Ohio, Cincinnati. Really? Yeah. When did you move to LA? Two months ago, two and a half months. Why did you move to LA? I was just looking for, just wanted to be in a new environment. Are you happy to do that? Oh, yeah, I'm ecstatic. Very happy. How do you feel about getting used to living in LA? It took a few weeks just to get adjusted because I didn't know it. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather is probably the best thing. Uh-huh. Yeah, and I mean, other than that, it's pretty much the same as everywhere else I've been. What are some things you don't really like about LA? There's nothing I don't really like about LA. It's just, you know, just the weather is the best part of it. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I like to travel somewhat. I haven't traveled a lot in my life, but over the past year and a half, I've done quite a bit of traveling. What do you enjoy about traveling? seeing different places, different people, new people, new faces, new places. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Let's see, well, last summer I spent the summer in Cleveland doing urban farming in the city. Yeah, and I stayed at a hostel, the first hostel in Cleveland. and I was doing a program with the and it was basically we would go to different urban farms throughout the city and volunteer about 20-25 hours a week. Really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing. Wanted to try something different, something I've never done before and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try because of you know because of a certain stigma that comes along with it and you know I just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that What's been your most memorable experience? Just seeing the difference in, you know, how fresh, natural food tastes, you know, as opposed to the food you buy at the grocery store. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. Yeah, it is. It really is. What did you study at school? I was, I took two semesters of college, and I was undecided. So I was just taking general classes. What's your dream job? Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I consider myself more shy. Why? I don't know why. It's just the way it is. Sometimes when you're in a tent, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I read, listen to music, I draw, watch movies, stuff like that. How are you at controlling your temper? I think I'm pretty good at it. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Wow. Wow. Yeah, I can't remember the last time I had an argument with someone. I don't know. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Again, I don't know because I don't dwell on things that happened in the past. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe whether or not to come to California. I guess that was a hard decision. Well, I don't know. I've been thinking about it, you know, moving to a new place for a long time. and I guess the hardest part of the decision was thinking whether whether or not I will be secure or not you know what I mean um just going to a new place where you don't know anyone it's kind of like you really don't know what's going to happen so there was a lot of you know fear in that decision should I go to a place where I don't know anyone I'm not familiar with the area you know only perception that I have of this area is you know, what I've seen in media and TV. So, you know, yeah, I guess that was the hardest decision that I can think of. Yeah. I guess so. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. yeah what's something you feel guilty about uh nothing i don't feel guilty about anything okay tell me about your relationship with your family uh a relationship with my family uh i'm not really close to my family I guess the person I'm closest to is my mom, but, you know, I don't, you know, I never really talked to her much. I don't really know my dad that well, so, you know. I guess my grandmother. Yeah, she's very, how should I say it? She's very, she's a thinker. I put it like that. Like, she's very insightful. So, yeah, I look to her for a lot of advice because she's been through a lot in her life. And I feel like she, you know, she's been through a lot, so she understands a lot. So, you know, she's a very positive influence. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very easy. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? Why? but you know it's not it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind feels like somehow maybe I'm running out of time and I know that's not like that's not that's not a realistic thought because I don't see how you could ever run out of time but yeah I guess yeah just general not knowing what I want but I know like how do I cope with that how do I cope with that I I don't know I just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul searching. It's not hard. I mean, I mean, I'm, it's like, I can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that I feel like it's necessary. And, you know, certain things in life, you just, you're forced to face. So it's harder to, I think it's harder to avoid those type of things. Yeah. No. No. No. uh maybe today when i talked when i uh talked to my friend earlier awesome yeah how would your best friend describe you how would my best friend describe me I guess he would say I'm quiet uh uh he would describe me as a nice guy uh that's insightful goofy. Yeah. Oh, I don't really think like that. No. 10 or 20 years ago, I guess I would tell myself to stick with what I love. I did a acting workshop and yeah I don't know it's always been an interest of mine and I decided why not you know let's try it see how you like it what am I most proud of like an event or an accomplishment I guess I'll pride myself on being independent yeah bye Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/467_P/467_AUDIO.wav,0
468,18,1," Okay. Yes, I'm okay with this. I'm pretty good. I'm feeling a little tired, but I'm feeling pretty good for the most part. That's good. Where are you from originally? Redondo Beach. Really? Yep. What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. I don't like the congestion of people here. And I don't like the cost of living in specific areas. I've been trying to actually last year was the summer of really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend we're looking to go to Costa Rica and hopefully to South America this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the south see some of the southern states but I've been to Canada, I've been to Mexico and Ecuador and been to various states here and there trying to get out there I love meeting new people, I love experiencing new things trying different foods that are native to that local area and it's just part of the journey I love exploring this planet we call Earth Just recently we went to Seattle in Canada with a couple friends and it was gorgeous. We flew into Seattle and we saw the city for the first two, three days and then rented a car and headed over to Vancouver, Canada and saw British Columbia and boy was it gorgeous. very lush beautiful trees the climate was nice the ocean was right there's people were great it's just a fun trip all around yeah one of my most memorable experiences was probably the trip we took to Colorado last summer and me and my girlfriend flew into Denver and we didn't really have a plan. We knew of a couple people who were living there and just the day before we had contacted them and told them we were coming to the area and they just showed great hospitality. They picked us up at the airport, let us crash at their place for a couple days. We even let us use their car to explore the state and go to Wyoming and see the neighbors to the north. It was just a great trip. Great people. Everything worked out very well. Every day was something new and fun to do. That's so good to hear. Yeah. What did you study at school? I studied business management and economics right now. What made you decide to do that? I've always wanted to own my own business and I figured management would be a good foundation to build on and learn more about. So I decided to go into management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business. And then economics was just for long-term investments. I really wanted to start owning some stocks, some ETFs, some mutual funds, and start building my portfolio up. So I figured economics would be a great way for a long-term investment financially. So that's why I did my economics. Yeah, I'm really stoked. it was one of the best decisions probably of my life. That's great. Yeah. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I consider myself more outgoing. I'm pretty friendly. I don't mind to open up to people and stuff. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the push-tick screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do when you're around? I like to be outside. I like to go hiking. I like to go, um, working out at the gym, but I mostly like to be outdoors. I love nature and just to be outside just, just puts me at ease. Okay. How long do you work in the gym? I'm pretty good for the most part. I'm a pretty mellow, chill guy and when I do get angry here there. I, uh, it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before I know it, I just, it just blows over. I don't tend to hold onto things or stay angry and hold grudges just cause there's no need to. Life's too short for all that. Um, see, I can't even remember the last time I argued with anybody. I had no idea. probably when my uh my brother and my girlfriend got in a little little argument uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kind of ever since um i wish i would have just handled it right then and there rather than it just stretch out as long as it has been. It's just awkward for both parties. I wish I just would have communicated with both of them and told them to set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see if we can come up with a solution. But now it's just awkward. Yeah, it does. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. the hardest decision I've ever had to make. Man, that's a toughie. I don't think I've had too many tough decisions to really say. The hardest decision I've ever had to make, maybe not moving to Colorado for my undergrad two, three years ago. It was a little tough just because I kind of think, what if? but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that was really that hard of a decision okay what's something you feel guilty about? I don't really feel guilty about anything I'm a pretty good person I think and for the most part I couldn't think of anything tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory Something I wish I could erase from my memory? Nothing really to be honest. I love all my memories. They're usually positive for the most part. I know it's kind of weird for somebody to say, but I've lived a pretty good life and I'm happy. That's great. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your family. adult. My girlfriend's family, they've been very positive in my life. If it wasn't for them, I think I'd be in a different direction. Just because in high school, I didn't really care about higher education. I didn't care about really thinking long term. And just seeing them and what their family does and how they think differently like through higher education and how to get somewhere in life and if you do these things this is what it could lead to and they've been very successful they own their own accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life. That's so good to hear. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good next week? It's pretty easy for the most part. I just close my eyes and wake up in the morning. I'm tired sometimes. I get a sense that I'm a little drained and maybe get a little groggy here and there. And that's it. Feeling pretty good for the most part. a little stressed out just because finals are around next week and I really really want to do well and just you know close out this last semester and I graduate in two weeks and for the most part that's that's the only thing I'm really nervous about but for the most part I'm really excited I'm looking forward to going to Maui for a week after graduation I'm fired up I'm fired up to see what the future holds where we're gonna meet my girlfriend and live and what other trips are planned for this summer I'm just excited to be done school for a little while. Awesome. Yeah. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have never been diagnosed with PTSD. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I've never been diagnosed with depression. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago. She had just graduated from nursing school on Monday. And just see her walk across stage and stuff just because we've been together for six years and seen her go through the nursing program for five and it's just see all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they wanted to achieve and just made me really proud of her probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurous love sports team player knows how to be a leader in there and it's a little outspoken sometimes not really for the most part no not really What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I understand. Oh, man. I couldn't... I can't really think of a time. I went caving two weeks ago that was a lot of fun we went up to Sequoia National Park and I went caving with a for an RCM class it's like this recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in Sequoia and just meeting these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down in the caves climb back up going through different rooms and shoots it was a lot of fun that was yeah 10 or 20 years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects and kind of stick with one sport just to see how far that could get you. Sometimes not playing hockey through middle school and high school sometimes. And that's pretty much it now. What are you most proud of in your life? eyes to that and now I have different perspectives and really have an open mind to people and rather than judging them, you know, it's liberty. Why not let them do what they want? And, uh, I'm really proud to just be finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my MBA in a couple of years. Okay. I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. For sure. Bye. Bye. All right. That was interesting.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/468_P/468_AUDIO.wav,0
469,39,1," I'm just supposed to watch or I'm supposed to do something? She's going to ask you questions and you're just going to have a conversation with her. Okay. She normally would. Okay. So you just go right into that. And again, when she says goodbye, just press this button and I'll come back in. Okay. You're welcome. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? L.A. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? There's a lot of variety. There's a lot of health-oriented stuff. There's all kinds of food to eat. You can go to the desert. You can go anywhere. I mean, there's a lot. And the weather's great. What are some things you really like about LA? The traffic. Lately the change in weather, it's kind of a little too unpredictable, but mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I wouldn't say a lot, just occasionally. What do you enjoy about traveling? It's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe I wouldn't normally do. Different people, learning about different people, different customs. Depends. I mean, if it's water, real pretty water, and being in beautiful water, relaxing. Adventure. I love adventure. I'd love to hear about all your friends. Um, uh, some time ago I went to Cayman Islands and, um, went on, I get seasick, but my sister gave me some medication. I went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and I accidentally got back on the wrong boat. Um, yeah. And, um, they're really crazy. They made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat. And I thought I was going to drown because the water was kind of rough. I was really shocked that they wanted me to do that. Yeah, but I survived. Yeah, pretty good. What did you study at school? Business management, but also hypnotherapy. I didn't hear that other question well I came from a serious kind of family so that just seems something that would be universal that would cover a lot of different subjects yes yeah but yes and no I mean now I kind of wish it was something different um I like communication I love speaking and interviewing strangers I'm very outgoing and funny so probably would have been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing what's your dream job? a dream job would just be out there you know like some of these people maybe on tv exploring different places and getting paid for it and always like a fun adventure interacting with people doing things I haven't done before and helping people you know, in some way with what I do, that they can see, you know, that I'm uncoordinated and in some ways, you know, they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV I go work out go walking I recently got like a bike that I kind of sort of fixed up go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping interact with friends call them see them that type of thing talk to strangers depends on the situation there's a bunch of times I'm good at it if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me it's a little tougher or people who are like really rude you know with the way they cut you off almost luckily not you know I'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot I'll confront them on that sometimes when was the last time you argued with someone? what was your argument? might have been with my sister It had to do with, I'm not sure of the topic, but whatever she was saying wasn't right. And we got in an argument, and it sounds childish, about who was right. You know, because she thinks she's always the smarter one because she's older. Sometimes it's frustrating because it's like it's a no-win situation. She just wants to hammer on somebody until they acknowledge that she's right. Other times I just let it go and let her rattle on because it's kind of non-productive. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm real close. I see my parents almost every weekend. more close to my mother I have a twin sister I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and I've got two other sisters so I stay in touch with all of them you know it's a mixed bag you know we kind of have a sort of aggressiveness in us a little bit but also um well me um and um ever i mean strangers sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me um strangers have been very um sometimes unexpectedly very nice I could be shopping and you know maybe I can't reach something and some guy will pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out that type of thing or if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody will like commiserate you know and um I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me um because he thought I didn't like his dog it was you know I'm not crazy about dogs but um he kind of flipped out for a year and a half and just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around. I wish I'd confronted that back then because I, you know, but it created a lot of anxiety for me because I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud instead of having to deal with the major stress from it. Now he and I don't talk at all. I just feel it's best. He's kind of odd. God, there's been a lot. Sometimes breaking up with somebody or yeah, it's usually or getting rid of a friend that type of thing sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past behavior with people, um, where maybe I wasn't as understanding. Um, when I was younger, I stole things, you know, that's not the best behavior and, um, and it's stuff like that. Oh God, there's a lot of them. I wish I could erase, you know, how tough my dad was on us as children and erase a lot of memories of men I dated that just didn't work out well at all and yeah I I can drop off like right away. Yeah. Cranky. Irritated. Snarky. A bit out of sorts. I've had some anxiety with money and relationships because I haven't been in one for so long. Meal. Just a lot of anxiety. Yeah. Take a deep breath. Try and do positive things. you know sometimes eat healthier work out more talk to my friend about it that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me well not officially but I know you know from things I've experienced that I've had I've you know, I get very anxious in certain situations. Are you triggered by something? Yeah, it's usually triggered by sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy, it triggers a lot of anxiety in me. If they're aggressive, whether it be physically or verbally, or sometimes if they're too much in my space, you know, where I am, it bothers me. Yeah, a long time ago. It was ages ago, maybe over 10 years ago, 15 years ago. I was depressed. I mean, I know that's nothing to laugh about, but I mean, it's kind of in a circle. Just to, wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more. What were your symptoms? Feeling stuck in certain thoughts, having a lot of negative thoughts, feeling of hopelessness, helplessness that type of thing I go occasionally it's a different type I'll go see a hypnotherapist sometimes to release anxiety that's in me Do you feel like therapy is useful? Yes I do, very useful What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? A lot more awareness of myself and other people. Learning more control, more confidence, better self-esteem, willing to try even more things, you know, whether I know the outcome or not, you know, of the unknown. I'll experiment a lot more. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Helping at the 25th mile, handing out water, and there were some people there who were doing that for the first time. time also some event at my sister's where there were just a couple of us and I was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes I'm like really funny you know and I can't even believe myself and I just go on and on you know and everyone starts laughing I'm not even trying to and I'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny and laugh yeah the how are your best friends As a really decent, loyal, empathetic, deserving, supportive, I'm hoping, outgoing, quirky type of person. what are some things you wish you could change about yourself um well it would be great to look even younger or be younger if that was humanly possible um be even more patient with people I think you know not get frustrated like if I think somebody's not very smart. Sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 15 years ago? Whoa. Wow. Make a lot of money and plan for your future. and try and be as kind and patient with people as possible and have a lot of fun, try new things. What are you most proud of in your life? I think of my mind and my perseverance that I've changed a lot of things within my personality. I feel proud of volunteer work. I feel proud I've helped a bunch of people lose weight, declutter their homes, and helped create a lot of positive change in people. That's great. Okay. I've asked everything I need to. Oh, okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Yeah, it was nice talking to you. Bye-bye. Bye. I'm going to stop here.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/469_P/469_AUDIO.wav,1
470,45,2," Okay. Should I look like straight up there or look at the screen? Yeah, just look at the screen. Okay. Okay. Okay, all right. Okay, thank you. Yes. Yes. I'm doing okay. I'm from Los Angeles, California. the food the weather and the people um I don't know it's not too many things I really don't like about LA maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in LA um no not too much um i only been like to texas las vegas and that's pretty much it um catching the airplane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to las vegas a lot that's oh yeah um well when i was younger i used to go visit my dad because he used to live in Houston, Texas, and I used to catch the airplane a lot, and that was a lot of fun. I wasn't scared. That was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed that. What was your study at school? When I went to school, I studied child development and nursing. Why did you decide to do that? I know I wanted to be somebody and when I went to school I wasn't sure what I wanted to be so I kind of took nursing the LVN program first and then I didn't want to be a nurse so I changed my major to child development and I graduated from that. No I'm actually looking for work I'm unemployed right now. My dream job will be probably doing something, working with the kids, opening up a nursery or something, my own business. In my mind, it's simple, but in reality, it seems like it's kind of difficult. Yeah. Do you consider yourself a child or a parent? sometimes I'm shy but I'm really an outgoing person and a people person um to relax I listen to some slow music I kind of like um have a quiet environment and maybe lay down, watch a little TV or something. I'm very good at controlling my temper. I don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where I'm going to hurt somebody. um when i really have arguments they're like because people don't agree to disagree and it's like really petty it's like we might say oh it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that. It's just stupid. I don't even remember. Um, probably not working right now. I need a job. Yes. Maybe I don't really remember a situation. I tried to really think before I really handle a situation and I try to handle it in my best positive way before I really do something I regret. Being with somebody, like a guy, you know, if I want to continue a relationship with them or just be single. um my relationship with my family I don't have I just really stay with my dad and I have a daughter and we just stay close all my family they're either in um Houston Texas or they're around but I don't really socialize with a lot of my family my dad because um I live with him right now I've been staying with him maybe about five to six years and he's just the only one I really look up to I don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and that's it She's in the fifth grade. She's graduating. She's going to the sixth grade and I'm kind of excited for that. Sometimes it's easy, but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming. The hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent. It's just you always have somebody to bring you joy. I enjoy always doing things with my daughter. It's just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always, it brings me so much joy being a parent. What are some ways that you're different from your parents? Well, my parents, when I was younger, they lived apart. So my mom, I don't know, I'm a much better parent because I'm more interested about what my child wants to do. I'm involved in her life, her every step. Just I'm really fully involved. My parents wasn't really that involved. You know, they had a drug problem. So it just, I had to mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids. so it was um just my parents and um their drug addiction I wish I could erase that from my memory um now I cope with them well but um when I was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own um they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know I just I didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything it just was like I was in the world by myself. Yeah. Oh, it's very easy. I sleep well every night. I can sleep anytime. I sleep very well. A little sad, but most of the time I'm very happy. I'm just not happy with where I am in my life right now. How do you understand the changes in your life? Have you ever been back in the office? no I haven't um the last time I felt very happy was when I graduated from um college I felt very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time I was really really very happy like that. I felt like I was on top of the world. I felt like just overwhelmed with joy. Just everything was just so exciting for me that day. I was just very, very happy. Nothing can make me upset that day. I was very happy. And when I think about that day it just it's a very happy experience for me um right now I don't really have a best friend I really try to I'm I try to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of positive choices so right now I'm just like um I really don't have any friends right now. My personality, I'm a happy person, I'm an outgoing person, and a positive person, and a good mother. Um, insecurities, like, um, sometimes I feel like, um, I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something. I feel like I can't get through something. I can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes. How many times have you felt really bad about yourself? Well, I did have a friend and she was, like, bipolar. and I tried to really be her friend no matter the disease she had. But she wasn't a really good friend because one day she started just being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything. And it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself, but it just made me pick my friends very wisely. yeah just being friends with certain people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it's just when I notice things about people that should determine whether I want to be their friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that that's a red flag and I shouldn't be these people friends yeah um to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track well I went um to a friend's house that I haven't seen since childhood and they it was just a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and I really enjoyed seeing my old friends that I didn't see in a long time and just being with my family and certain friends I really enjoy because I'm really always in the house I really don't go out that often so just I enjoy being with a group of friends and family and having a good time yeah um I'm proud that I did get my GED I did graduate and I do want to be somebody and I'm very proud that I want to be a better parent than my parents thank you goodbye okay Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/470_P/470_AUDIO.wav,1
471,21,1," Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing well, thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? From Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about L.A.? Sports, outdoor sports mainly. Like what? Surfing, snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing. Awesome, awesome. What are some things you don't really like about L.A.? Traffic. I see what you mean. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? Experiencing different cultures. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, I love going to Mexico and it's so much different from California and Western culture so to speak. I know Mexico is a Western civilization but the level of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that they're like two different worlds. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Traveling you mean? I would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji the name is Tabarua and it's a very small island you can walk around it in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes and it's a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible visually incredible and experientially incredible place I studied biology I I was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also. Are you still working in that? Not at all. I'm working in areas of business now. Are you happy you did that? Yes I am. What's your dream job? My dream job would be to be a missionary. Really? Yes. Can you tell me about that? My father's initial objective when he became an MD was to become a missionary and he's a very generous person and I think I am too. I got that from him hereditarily but I would like to help people and I don't think being a doctor is helping people. I really don't. it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources things like that if I could afford to travel to remote places like that What do you do to relax? I exercise. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? It was probably two days ago. It was my girlfriend and it was about her lack of consideration. I felt frustrated. Hmm. A situation which I wished I could handle differently. In my later years, I would say I don't have many regrets. In my younger years, I used to be snubbed by people, and I would keep my mouth shut, and I wouldn't say anything. I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior. I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings. I have learned that that is so wrong, And so in probably the last 15 to 20 years, I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away. And that takes care of the anger immediately. Has that gotten you in trouble? Yes. It depends what you mean by trouble. I think all the way around, once you take the beginning to the end, it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble. That makes sense. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Going back, it would be not to pursue medicine like my father wanted. We argued at length for many months and years about this, and finally I prevailed, and I didn't go that route. But that was probably the most difficult period in my life. I see. Tell me about November, or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. There was a time when I wished I could erase female interactions, girlfriends and their betrayals. But now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today and dealing with them defines who I am today. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My parents are deceased. I had very good relationships with my parents. I'm very thankful for that. Even though my father was somewhat of a hard-handed, draconian person, we came to an understanding well before he died. My brothers, I get along great with my younger brother, but my older brother has issues. He has psychological issues and they continue to plague him and to affect me also just knowing that he's going through turmoil. How do you cope with them? Well I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed and he has suicidal tendencies and he's not working. He's very highly educated and he doesn't talk to me and his family is very abusive towards him. not a happy relationship for his family. That sounds really hard. Yes. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? You know, I would have to say my father. My father is my hero. He's my model. He's my archetype for what a man should be. He was unimpeachably honest and kind. yet on the other hand he was he had high expectations of me and my two brothers usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that I received one month ago. How have you been feeling lately? With my own personal methods of handling stress, I'm okay. I'm probably 90% okay. That 10% comes from an unsureness about the future, about whether I will survive this or not. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. Do you feel down? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Never. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Never. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Oh, I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking. I always experience joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion. That's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, jovial, intelligent, perfectionist. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Hmm, no one's asked me much about that. uh... maybe uh... to submerge my hedonistic self i look at once again and my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate uh... uh... defer of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the self-made man that he was whereas I am looking always for the present how I feel now and it's difficult for me to slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. It would be my ex-boss. And he started using, at my last day of work when he fired me, he started using a lot of profanity toward me. And I turned to him and I said, you cannot talk to me that way. And he continued to use more profanity. until I objected to it again, and that's when he fired me. And that's still in my mind, and that occurred a year and a half ago. Wow. Mm-hmm. Is there anything you regret? Anything I regret? Oh, yeah, I regret not getting married and having kids. Have you done anything to avoid it? Sure, I suppose I could, but I think that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the United States is not the end of the world. Once you get to travel you find out that we are not, we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world. Other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree. I see what you mean. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good one. I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end. And I think I've done that. And I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer. So I think I'm happy with my life thus far. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I was giving a rock climbing lesson. I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing. And many of these people have never done it before. And they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives. So that was very gratifying to me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I would say my devotion to the environment. I wasn't always an environmentalist, but I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment because today there are a lot of people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that. And I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. That was interesting. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/471_P/471_AUDIO.wav,0
472,19,1," Okay. Sure. So, how are you doing today? I'm well, thank you. That's good. Where are you from and where are you from? Southern California. Really? What are some things you really like about the area? The weather, the mountains, the ocean. What are some things you really like about the area? traffic, air quality. No, not a lot. Time, money. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied art, studio art. How did you decide to do that? It was just always a talent and a desire I had from childhood. Are you still working on that? I am. What's your dream job? Hmm, making a good living through my art. It's challenging. Well, I need, it's about having the time and finding a niche that appeals to others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision. Somewhere in between. I read, I walk dogs, I spend time with my family. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Oh, it's very good. I love my family very much, and they love me very much. We're very supportive of each other. That's so good to hear. How are you at the company? I'm pretty good most of the time. I'm not so great when I'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic, but it's not out of control. I don't really remember. I want to say it was probably my daughter, and it was probably about something stupid, some little stupid thing. um my daughter is um 39 beautiful brilliant um very talented very uh uh goal driven my son is 27 he is more laid back very sweet and he's starting to be a little more goal driven a little less satisfied with just the daily grind being a parent is very challenging in a wonderful way. I think the hardest thing is fear and worry for your children. Today's world can be very violent and scary and you fear for your children's safety and well-being. I'm sorry? Oh, gosh. The close friendship you have with your children, the love, the support, the joy of just everyday little things that you share. Oh. Well, I talk to my children about anything and everything. have very open communication, which in my parents' generation, I think children were more seen and not heard. Tell me about a situation that you would see a woman with a baby. Well, with my daughter, my first child, I was young. and inexperienced not only in being a mother but naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general. And I think probably most parents have regrets of situations they may have had their children in when they were young that weren't the best. What's something you feel guilty about? Sometimes I feel that I should have been more aware at a younger age. Can you tell me about that? um just just decisions and situations that decisions you make situations you find yourself in when you're younger out of being naive and and um even though logically I know that it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time you know as you get older you hindsight is 20-20 as you get older you you look back and wish that you had to been more on top of your your your life when you were younger oh gosh I honestly can't think of anything.

How does it compare to LA? It's How does it compare to LA? It's different It's not as busy There's more things to do outdoors In the mountains Why is it for LA? For work Are you happy with it though? Yeah I am I love it here That's good How easy is it for you to get used to living in LA? It took about a year before I really felt comfortable, but once I got through that kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here. I had a good time. What are some things you really like about LA? I love that I can go to the beach. I love that it's warm most of the time. I love that I've met a lot of people that love the arts as much as I do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic, just like everyone else. Yeah. Yeah, the traffic, and it's pretty much just traffic. Earthquakes. Not as much as I'd like. It's just nice to go someplace new, experience something different. I'd love to hear about all your effects. I went to Alaska a couple years ago and that was really awesome. I got to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick. That wasn't awesome, but it was cool. I saw a bear in real life. A bear walked through a yard. It was really different than LA. It was really cool. Nice. What did you study at school? English creative writing. How did you decide to do that? Well, I always wanted to tell stories, so it just made sense to work on writing in somehow, some aspect. Are you still working on that? Yeah, I am. What's your dream job? To have my own TV show where I write it, and everyone watches it every week, and it's awesome. Cool. How hard is it? Why?

When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Um, it was at work a couple, about a month ago, about a month ago. Um, I got mad at someone because I didn't think they were, they were giving me clear instructions. And so, um, when I tried to have a conversation about it, they got mad and then I got mad and we got mad. Um, I felt like I wasn't being heard or listened to, and I felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so um because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me totally um i uh i um no regrets no home i yes i don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but uh... one time i was driving behind someone and they will they cut me off and it is still one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago uh... as well as days where justin one or I just, it had been a frustrating day, and when this person cut me off, and I almost got in an accident with them, I just followed them to their parking spot, and actually, I had honked at them, and they, they flipped me off, and so, it just really, really got into my skin that someone would cut me off, and almost cause an accident, and then, and then flip me off, so I, I followed them to the spot, and I asked, I said, miss, why did you flip me off when you cut me off, and she said, oh, you know, I've had a rough day. I don't need your attitude. And her daughter was with her and I told her, well, you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter. And, you know, I didn't need to be petty like that, but I just wanted to be, I guess. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Ooh, look at you going deep. I guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom, telling her I was gay. I mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative. And she had trouble accepting it. And it took a while, but once she did, you know, everything was better. And I knew it would be, but it was just hard in the moment to, you know, tell her something she didn't want to hear. Okay. Okay. When I was a little kid My grandfather found our dog Run over on the road And he And brought it in And I remember as a kid just And, like, seeing death like that really just threw me off and frightened me. And it was just one of those moments that I guess I wish I hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed. She was just so sad. And it was just one of those moments I guess you need as a kid, but I didn't really want to experience, like, loss like that in your face. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family is pretty good. We're probably not as close as most, but we, you know, we always, we don't talk often, but we talk with love. And we always love each other when we see each other. That's so good to hear. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was very positive. She was always very encouraging and told me to pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down. So I'm glad I had her. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Usually it's easy. Sometimes it's not. Can you tell me about that? Well, I've been between jobs recently. I start a new job next week. but while I've been off, while I haven't been working I tend to like, my body wants to stay up later and later and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11 so I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12.30 and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but I just don't want to stay up, I guess. I'm a little scatterbrained. Like today, I'm a little scatterbrained because I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning. So, scatterbrained. Well, since I've had a lot of time on my hands, like I don't usually have this much time on my hands, so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working, I guess. But, yeah, I think that answers the question. Okay. Have you ever seen a change in your behavior or thoughts lately? I just thought maybe I'm a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the not working thing. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. A couple days ago when I got my new job. When I got hired. Outgoing, listening, attentive, fun, loyal. I think. I hope. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish that I... I probably wish that I looked better. I wish I had more hair up here. Losing it a little bit. I probably wish I was a little skinnier. This girdle's pretty tight. and um you know sometimes i wish i had more money but nothing too drastic i'm okay yeah oh um when i was a little kid i was uh i was the i was the fat kid and um gosh i remember i was like i was going into high school and it was like the second day and i remember this guy came up to me and was um like he was like pretty nice to me i thought and then i didn't realize he'd like this is like out of a movie right like he had put band-aids on my back that said like i'm a fat cow and said like uh like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and i didn't know and i walked around with it for like half an hour i heard people laughing and i didn't get it and then finally this girl just came up to me and was like hey there's like band-aids on your back that sell these mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take them off and i remember like i couldn't get them i was trying to find them and then um i just remember like putting my head in my locker and like i didn't want anyone to see me cry so i just like put my head in my locker and like pretend like i was looking at stuff in my backpack but really i was you know the crying fat kid who can get the mean stickers off his back yeah anything um probably yeah um you know i would i would try to keep i would try to let myself know to to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you i think i spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as i got older i didn't care as much and I started enjoying life a lot more. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I went to Coachella. It's a music festival. It was three days with all of my friends and my boyfriend, and we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time. Awesome. Yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? Oh, I guess my career, humble as it may be, I really stuck in LA a long time. When it was hard, I stuck around. I didn't quit. So, you know, I'm proud that I've managed to, like, follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to.

Well, in junior college I did communications, a lot of public speaking classes, so I went on and transferred to a university and wanted to study the same thing, I guess. Are you still working in that? Yeah, I work in advertising now. What's your dream job? Dream job. Probably to work for a big golf company and do their advertising for them. Awesome.

I think I like to run and be outdoors. I surf a lot, so anytime I'm stressed, I definitely just try to go to the gym or wake up earlier and surf before work. How are you at controlling your temper? I don't really have a temper. I'm pretty mellow. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? I haven't really argued with anyone.

477,19,1," Okay, sounds good. Thanks. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes, thanks. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm well, thank you. How are you? I'm good. I'm great, thanks. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Oklahoma. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to L.A.? I moved to L.A. about five and a half years ago. So I used to be on the East Coast and then I decided I wanted to come out here. How often do you go back to your hometown? hometown not very often most of my family's moved away so I visit them but I don't actually get back to Oklahoma much Oklahoma is very different LA is a lot more exciting there's a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice. Why did you move to LA? You know, that's a good question. I wanted to try something new, and I've always loved the beach, and I thought, and I also like big cities, so I thought LA might be a good place for me to come. Are you happy with your job? Very. It's probably one of the best decisions I ever made. That's so good to hear. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Pretty easy, I think. It seems kind of natural. It seemed like a good fit. I just really like it here. How do you like your living situation? Oh, it's great. I have a couple of roommates and we get along really well. I live a couple of blocks from the beach. And every day I get to walk on the beach or, you know, hang out with friends. And it's just, it's kind of like being on vacation all the time. It's really nice. Awesome. What did you study at school? I studied philosophy and political theory and government and did a little bit of English literature on the side. How did you decide to do that? It kind of just happened naturally, I think. I went to liberal arts school and got kind of an exposure to a lot of different areas. and I just followed what I liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that. Are you still working in that? Not exactly. I work for an educational nonprofit, so I work with graduate students in the social sciences and humanities, but I don't actually use my philosophy background very often. What's your dream job? You know, I have actually studied to become a success coach. And so working with students is kind of a nice aspect of doing that. But I'd really like to work with other people, so not just students, but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams. How hard is that? I'd say it's fairly hard in the sense that it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their dreams. But it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money, So finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult, too. I'm definitely on the shyer side. I'm an introvert. I'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people, but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people, I'm very much an observer, so I tend to listen a lot, and I'm not as engaged. and I think that is something that is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them, especially if they're not introverted. So I'd say, and it's also a challenge for me. I tend not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers. Okay. How long do you have a temper? Pretty good, I think. But I do have a temper, So I can get upset from time to time. Has that gotten you in trouble? Not really. It can be a challenge when I'm driving. But other than that, no. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? I'm not sure. It would have probably been a discussion over politics. And it probably would have been a friendly argument. probably with one of my liberal friends. But I actually can't remember the specific time. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I meditate. I do that almost every day. I also walk at the beach. I love the ocean, and I really like the sounds, and just being out there is very peaceful. And I like to read and be alone just with my thoughts. So that's nice. That's good. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, let me think about that for a minute. I'm having a hard time coming up with anything. I mean, I'm sure there are plenty of things. Just nothing comes to mind. Let's come back to that. Okay, I'm sorry. well this isn't exactly an event it's what's a dream and it's not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but I do have it sometimes probably more often than I'd like so I wouldn't be upset if it you know if I didn't have it and it's just a version of a dream that I think a lot of people probably have but it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know I'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it, wishing why didn't I study and attend a class the way I should have, which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school, but now I have this dream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating. And I'm not exactly sure why. I mean, I know why, but I don't know what it applies to because it's not like I am worried consciously at least about failing things. Are you afraid of something? No, I don't think so. at least not that I'm aware of I feel guilty I have a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and I love my nephew, he's eight, he's adorable and I, when I used to live there when he was younger, spent a lot of time with them And since I've been in California, and particularly in the last year, I've spent a lot less time visiting them. So, for example, I saw them for a week at Christmas, and then I went back at the beginning of May. So it was, you know, four months between the last time I'd seen them. And that I felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company, and he, you know, really likes me to be there. But then he gets upset when I leave, and he asks, when am I coming back? So that makes me feel bad sometimes. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I have a brother. I'm very close to him. He's younger. He's like four, four and a half years younger. He's married. I have a nephew. Both of my parents have passed away. So it's just the two of us. and we have a large extended family, but we're not that close with them, with most of them. On my father's side, there's one brother, and he's married and has a few kids, so I have a few cousins on that side. But then on my mother's side, there are four or five other kids, most of them with several children of their own. So I have a lot of cousins on that side. but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook and there are a couple that I talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Um, say well, I mean I have a lot of friends I think that have been positive influences. When I came out to California, I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place. It was very different from what I was used to. It was a little bit challenging and she also worked there. So we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship. And she's kind of, I would say, my best friend probably here and probably just in general. and now she's moved to Vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we're going to Napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very positive influence because when I came out here and didn't really know anybody and you know since I'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know I think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and that's been nice I'm a sleeper so it's pretty easy um sometimes my you know depending on how long I've been awake I can be a little wound up and so sometimes I have to take a little while to decompress but I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful and I can sleep I generally sleep in 90 minute cycles so usually 6 or 7 and a half hours but I can easily sleep 9 hours if I have the time and inclination I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if I do I don't remember it What do you like when you don't sleep well? Well I actually don't sleep very well when I travel one of the things I do for work is I travel quite a bit because I work for a company that's back east. So I work from home most of the time, but then I travel like one week a month. And when I travel, I'll take the red eye, and then I'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much. It's not that I sleep poorly or badly. It's just that I don't have that much time to sleep. And the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay. Usually the second day is not very good. so I get a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate and I don't know it just feels like more of a struggle. Okay how have you been feeling lately? I'd say good. Summer is a busy time for the organization that I work for so I'm a little I don't know if stressed is the right word but I'm you know, a little anxious about everything going well this summer, but in general, I'm feeling pretty good. Not really. I can't, I can't think of anything. There is one thing. I do struggle with exercise. Like, I like to walk a lot, and I hike with friends, and I had been really motivated about it for a couple of months, but then I went away to the East Coast, and when I came back, I was a lot less motivated because I didn't really exercise when I was there, and I'd gotten out of the habit, even though it had only been about 10 days, and so now I'm struggling to try and get back in the routine, and it's not going as well as I would like. That's okay. Thank you. No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Well, he's a lot of fun, and he really likes me, and I really like him, and we play a lot of games and talk a lot, and we're actually doing a book club now, so we're going to Skype, and maybe I'll get some more time with him that way. But just being around him is fun. How do your best friends describe you? those are probably the main things. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I had more self-discipline. So I wish that, you know, I could diet or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because I love to eat sugar. I wish that I would not procrastinate because I've gotten a lot better about that, but I still do, and that can be challenging. And I wish that I, I don't know, I think I wish that I was in a relationship. So, probably those things. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really valued about yourself. Hmm. Hmm. So, at the last organization I used to work at, I had a boss and she was, I don't feel like she was, I don't think we were very compatible. And she used to push my buttons, or so I thought. And so, one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer. And he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department. So she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was. But it wasn't, I've been a manager for many years and I have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with staff members. And the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate I thought and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel you know incompetent or at least that's the way that I felt about it and I did you know I tried to be very calm and said that I would take care of it and I did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn't really the same and I ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that I'd worked for. Not that long afterwards, because I just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me, or after we had that interaction. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? So I heard this piece of advice the other day, or this thing that I thought was really profound, and I wish that I had read it back then, which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 I want it I'm gonna buy it it don't think of it as costing $100 think of it as costing ten times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have ten times that much money eventually. So you should really think about it in those terms. And I think I've been much more consumer than a saver. And so I wish that I had been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably they asked me to be his godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that I was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them. So. Let's see. Well, it wasn't really recently, but in February, I went, I like to travel and a friend and I went to Singapore and I got to fly first class. We used miles, frequent flyer miles to get the tickets and so that was really enjoyable because the seats fold down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and I also hadn't been to Singapore before so that was kind of cool too sure thank you bye Hey.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/477_P/477_AUDIO.wav,0
478,59,2," I'm going to do it again. Okay. I'm just curious to talk to people in the safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but if you do learn about people and you want to learn about you, I'll ask you a few questions to start. And please feel free to send me a message. The answers are totally confidential. Are you a therapist? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good, thanks. That's good. The east coast. For work? Rarely. I prefer it out here. I prefer it out here. It's not as nice as the lifestyle out here. I like the weather better and the weather is better. lifestyle out here. I like the weather better and there's just a lot of things about living here. It's my favorite city. Somewhat. But I mostly... What's that? What do you enjoy about France? Why? What did you study at school? It sounds interesting. Why did you decide to do that? and I thought it was a good classical education. And I interned at Andy Warhol's magazine when I was in high school, and so that... Yes. Yes. What is your new job? How hard is it? Can you tell me about that? I don't know, it's hard to talk to someone about it who's not in marketing. It requires just the knowledge of how it's done, and it takes several months to do one. Okay. Do you consider yourself a child or a villain? Well, I guess I'm originally kind of shy, but I become more outgoing just because of work and stuff. I like to exercise I do hiking with my dogs we walk up and down a hill a couple times Okay. How are you at continuing your company? Good. What was the last time you argued with someone and what did they say? Uh, I don't remember. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. I don't know, nothing comes to mind. What's something you feel things you don't like? Sometimes I don't clean my car. I get lots of dog hair in it, and I feel bad when I should always stay on top of that, just getting to the car wash and stuff. Well, I had a conflict with my brother and so I had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense and that was a somewhat difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior, it wasn't that difficult but it was somewhat difficult because I loved him very much. How many of your relationships with your family? I'm not close to my family, so I don't really have one. Okay. I have a Japanese friend. Uh-oh, I think the sensor came off. I have a Japanese friend I'm very close with. She's like kind of my mother. and I just met them socially uh i don't know nothing comes to mind yeah i think the sensor came off okay it's kind of a Oh, sure. Okay. Okay. Pretty easy because I keep a regular schedule. I'm just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable good um well I'm recovering from PTSD so I sometimes feel the the PTSD and then and I'll take a medication for that. No, it's just left over. I still have the stress from it. I'm still being treated for it. I don't really have any. I prefer not to talk about it. In the past, but it's treated. Um, five years ago? What brought you to the hospital? Uh, I was just very sad, very depressed, and so I also had anxiety. So I went to the doctor and they helped me. Then I did psychotherapy. Do you still live with that now? Yeah, for the PTSD though. What's your experience with the new list? I don't know. I guess it's just kind of supportive because of the issues I have with my family. It's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive. And, you know, it just gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions, that sort of thing. I yeah I have nightmares about my family sometimes yeah oh I I just try to sleep better I before you go to sleep I sort of like meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help. I feel happy all the time, pretty much. Like, my dogs make me happy and, you know, my life is really happy. I guess, you know, as a nice person, I'm thoughtful. a good friend and happy fun person I don't know I mean I'm in my 40s now so I'm pretty happy with myself you know I've done a lot of work on myself in therapy and stuff so I'm pretty I wouldn't really change a lot. I'm pretty happy with myself. I mean, not to sound conceited, but I'm pretty happy with myself now. Oh, that would be my parents. They're very abusive, so I don't talk to them anymore. So any times with them, they did terrible things to me. I prefer not to talk about it. Let's see. Well, I just started reading a book. I like to read cookbooks, and I was just reading a book called When French Women Cook, and it's about a woman's relationship with different women in France and different parts of France and the cooking. So I'm really enjoying that book. Nice. Mm-hmm. How do you spend your day doing things? I usually get the grocery shopping done, which I enjoy. I really like doing the grocery shopping. I go to a few places and then do a bit of cleaning and just relax. Oh, yeah, I would say to have better self-esteem because I used to have very low self-esteem, you know, from being abused. And so, you know, I wish I'd been happier in the past. And, you know, it's taken me a long time to become happy because, you know, no matter what I did, whatever achievements, I was never happy in the past. I was always, you know, struggling with being depressed. I didn't even know why. And now, you know, I realize because of whatever events that it was from my parents, from that relationship. And so the advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you. Like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship. Just the way I live my life, the way I treat people. I think, you know, I believe your deeds are very important, and I try to treat people in a good way. And I guess, you know, I'm proud of my work, like decisions I've made that give me a job that I like, that gives me a lot of flexibility, and I do what I like. and people like my work. And also my dogs, I'm really proud of them. Yeah, I don't know. Okay. Thank you. Bye. That was funny. Interesting experience. Yeah. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now. And then just do this.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/478_P/478_AUDIO.wav,1

Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um... The vehicle I bought, I should have bought something more affordable. Like a car. I should have bought something more affordable. Like maybe something more economic. That makes sense. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. How did you decide to do that? How do you like your living situation? That's good. It's affordable. That's good. Tell me about your relationship with your family. That's good right now. How close are you to your family?

Not being financially stable. Can you tell me about that? Well, ever since I moved to LA, when I tried to fit into a job, something happened to that business. They either lay people off or sell the business or, you know, they don't pay, they cut the pay. So it's been tough. Yeah, that sounds really hard. Really? It can be tough to find a good job these days. Who's side of it's been a positive influence in your life? Um, nobody really. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Um, I have to work out and to be able to get my body tired before I go to sleep. What are you doing when you don't sleep well? I'm tired, falling asleep wherever I go if there's nothing going on.

480,23,1," Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thanks, Rachel. Thanks, Rachel. Yes. I'm fine, thank you. New York City. Yes. 1975. About once a year. Both urban, big cities, but East Coast has a little bit, maybe a little more character. West Coast, a little more weighed back. With family. Came with my family. I was young. I like the weather. I like the women are beautiful. The culture is fantastic. The city affords a lot of opportunities employment-wise. Lots of good things. What are some things you don't really like about Florida? Traffic. Traffic. People who only care about themselves. I can't see your shoes. I've traveled a bit, Europe and throughout the States, yeah. The new experience is it's always fun to travel to. get a break from where you are and have new experiences. And the great thing about it, too, is when you return home, it kind of helps you reset your, it kind of makes you appreciate coming home as well. Well, you know, I've been to Spain and England and Italy, different different places probably Barcelona loved Barcelona the architecture and the well food was was a part of it but just the my experiences there were fantastic What did you study at school? Art history. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I was always good artistically, so it seemed natural. Probably should have studied graphic design, which I later got into. What's your dream job? to be the star of my own TV show I would be the most hilarious comedian making the entire country laugh at my brilliant comedic point of view on life outgoing always have been as an actor as a kind of a comedian I do I'm a comedian as well and you have to be outgoing it's more fun What do you do to relax? Try to take a peaceful walk, do yoga. How long do you do it from time to time? Much better. I used to be, I think when I was younger, not so good. Lately, I'm actually very proud of it. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? I think the only time I really argue is on the phone with Time Warner Cable. I don't know. It's been a while. Maybe not working hard enough some days. When you're a freelancer, it's hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had done differently. Well, I don't know. Can we come back to that one? I can't think right now. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Probably once when I moved back to Los Angeles from Boston and I had a girlfriend at the time and it was hard to leave. I knew I had to come back, but I think that particular move west was... What made you decide to do that? Felt it was calling me and that's where my connections were and I had to come home. I think so, yes. Yes. Erase from my memory. I don't know. Gosh, I mean, I don't know. Something you feel guilty about. Maybe, you know, maybe doing something when you're a little, you've had a couple of extra drinks and you made out with a girl that you shouldn't have. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's pretty good. I think they're a challenge. My folks are together. I've got a sister. My sister's in New York. Not the tightest family, but, you know, I'm grateful for everything that I've derived from it. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? I have a best friend that I went to college with, and he's very smart. I consistently call him when I'm having challenges, life challenges. I will consistently call this, well, a few specific friends to get advice and I like that. I have a couple of friends who have been tremendously influential and supportive. Friends are, good friends are very important. Yeah. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Sometimes. Most of the time. Not horrible, but not amazing. I mean, it's okay. What are you most motivated about? Dragging. Not motivated. Or, yeah. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. pretty good that's no I mean there I think they're consistent with the way I've been for a while No. No. No. I think when I get consistent work, when I do a lot of creative stuff, get a lot done creatively. I guess I would hope something like you know a charismatic fun loyal guy I wish I were more, more aggressive, more consistent with pursuing dreams. I do a lot. I do enough. Sometimes I get down on myself for not trying harder to do all the artistic things I love to do. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel recently I signaled into a lane and this woman was shouting at me I could hear it because our windows were open it was a hot summer day and then later I drove up beside her and I said in a pleasant way I was just trying to signal to get into your lane because she was cursing at me through the window prior to that. And she just lifted up her finger and gave me the finger. And it was just... It's funny. Sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal, loving way and all they have for you is hate. And that did make me feel bad. A little angry. No, because I took the high road. But she regrets, I'm sure. Just go out with friends, make dinner. Recently, a bunch of, I had a small party at my house, and one guy cooked food, and we had a bunch of friends over, and that's always fun. Nice. What advice could you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Let's see. Never get too up or too down, don't accentuate the highs and lows. Why? Because there's always a different, it's an endless roller coaster, So you need to be prepared for that long ride. Creative things, the creative, the performances, the comedic performances, the commercials I've done, the acting, the stand-up comedy, the graphic design, all my creative filmmaking, all my creative outlets that are an expression of me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. That was funny. That was the funniest point that just made me laugh.

And again, when she's done and says goodbye, just press that button. All right. Okay? Hello. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm hearing a lot about evil and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions before I start. I'm pretty scared for you, but this is a very important thing. Are you a favorite place? So, how are you doing today? That's good. Where are you from this morning? Really? What are some things you really like about LA? Just a lot of different kinds of people, and I love the weather most of the time, and great creative scene. I'm really into music, so it's a great scene for that. What are some things you never really like about driving? I don't like driving. I don't know who does. Right? It's just such a drag. And getting from point A to point B is just a daily need. And it doesn't get any easier. It's too many people. Too many people. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. I can't see your shoes. Can I have a lot? yeah when I can when I can afford to what do you enjoy about traveling? just being somewhere else not having to drive usually most places have better public transportation I'm a culture junkie I like experiencing different types of cultures I haven't been to that many places I've been to like Mexico and Italy. It's, you know, I want to go to more places. I want to go to Japan. So that'll be interesting. It's usually just with my family. It's my mom, sometimes my girlfriend, sometimes my brother. And we just, yeah, we go to Italy. We spent two weeks there, though. That was cool. Nice. Yeah. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Living next to the best gelato shop in Italy. When we were in Florence, spent a week in Florence. That was great. Very good culture there as well. Art. What did you study at school? Studied film and digital media because I make music and I wanted to learn how to make music videos. So, that's something I'm trying to get into. Are you still working on that? Yeah, yeah, I mean, I need to get a camera though, that's the thing. But my main focus is music. I studied film, but my focus is music. Can you tell me about that? Sure. I've been playing music. I've been playing guitar, keyboard, bass, drums for about 12 years now. And I do production and songwriting. I'm in an indie rock band. That's a great website. I highly recommend it. And it's mine, so check it out. Okay. What's your dream job? International rock star, music producer, and filmmaker, director. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Probably outgoing. Why? I just feel like it's a way to get the most out of life. Talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you. It kind of just goes with the territory. yeah um I do meditation and it's not really hard because it's fun and it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time which uh That was a huge epiphany for me, that you can relax and focus at the same time. Because normally when I'm relaxing, I'm tuning out. I'm focusing on something else. But to be able to combine those sensations was, yeah, I've been doing that for about three months now. That's good. Yeah, it is. How many good at times are you doing? Almost two good at times. sometimes there's things that should be said that I don't just because you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example you got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily so you can do anything to them and I've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but you know I make do probably argued with the guitarist for my band we had a falling out we're not going to be in a band together I mean we're still friends so at least there's that but it was just basically about creative control of the project and how we're going to prioritize it in our lives. And, you know, our priorities weren't the same, and I got very upset. So that was the end of that. How did you feel about that? I felt good that it was definitive, that it was, you know, a choice had been made on both parties. Also regretful that, you know, he didn't feel the way that I wanted him to feel about it, which was excited about the project. So the fact that he wasn't really in, it kind of pissed me off. But I got over it. And, you know, I got some other people that are really, really excited to be working with me, even honored. So, you know, I'm going to keep going. That's great. Thank you. I'm glad you're in a situation where you can see the difference. um, hmm, I don't know, I don't really, I don't really have any regrets like that at the moment, I can't really think of any, um, um, when I was in high school, I cheated on my girlfriend, I didn't think it would mean anything at the time, but I did it. I regret it, but, you know, life happens. You make some mistakes. Selfishness. Being young and thinking it wouldn't matter. you know, thinking, you know, you only live once, and, you know, for, it's probably for the best, ultimately, because, you know, I love my current girlfriend, and I would never do that to her, so, that was, that was years ago, but, she was a nice girl, she didn't deserve that, so, I regret it. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. um shoot jeez um i guess uh whether to go to college or not because i i had some projects going in la that i didn't really want to shut off i had a band going we had a manager um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and um i made the decision to go to school in Santa Cruz and start a new life there for four years. It was a difficult decision, but I'm glad I did because I met a lot of people, a lot of people I'm still close with today that we work on stuff together and all that, so it's good. I agree. It is good. Thank you. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could risk in New York. maybe I wish I could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when I was four by a Danish babysitter. You know, on the abuse scale it's pretty low, but it was somewhat humiliating and I don't forget it. So, I have a pretty vivid picture of it and I'd be happier if it wasn't there. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's positive. They're supportive. They give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that I keep things in perspective in terms of how I'm going to support myself even though I do. It's just, you know, I have a more long-range picture than they do and I have faith in myself and the creative projects that I make so yeah there's a bit of tension there just because you know they expect certain things from me and I expect them as well but I just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer but they're sweet people how do i cope with them uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know um cope with them because i love them i just uh you know times i'll just uh go off on my own for a while and you know take a breather whatever you know everyone makes you mad sometimes so challenging and just I try it doesn't work sometimes I have to take medication for it I have to take Ambien something like that yeah I'm someone who sleeps in late so I always get at least six or seven hours if I have to wake up early for something I get nauseous sometimes I'll throw up in the morning yeah I've had jobs where I wake up and you know vomit while I'm brushing my teeth it's horrible it does suck it's kind of something I'm worried about you know I kind of need to get some part-time work while I'm not you know getting a steady pay flow for my music production so yeah it's pretty rough got some stuff I need to get over I'm not really sure how just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something that doesn't sit well with me like being in a you know a rushed and you know stressful work environment it just um unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to to give a shit frankly like and you know i try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know my body doesn't want that in the morning it just i feel like my body rejects things and yeah okay I've been feeling okay very very reflective very contemplative you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be some new people in my life some new people in my band um you know I'm gonna try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time because, you know, I expect more from myself. It's just pissing me off when I get, you know, I basically feel like I'm shitting all over myself. My body's shitting on me anyway just by being so shitty. Yeah. No. Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Why? if it sucks. Being forced to. It was a private school. They thought I was acting up. They thought I was an uppity kid. I think I was just being a kid. Yes, I do. Well, I haven't been in 12 years, but I do think that it might be helpful for me in the future. Can you tell me about that? I thought you weren't a therapist. That's a typical therapist question right there. Well, yeah, I kind of want to go back to therapy. It might help. It might help me find some solutions. Maybe it's not a therapist, maybe it's a life coach, I have no idea, but I'll be seeking help soon. Okay. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Yesterday. I was watching a movie with my girlfriend, and I looked over at her, and we smiled at each other, and it was great. Aw. Yeah. How were your best friends like? I'm very honest, sometimes brutally so, but I'm a good guy. I think that my friends all think I'm a good guy. Probably funny, open-minded. I guess what I'm working on, which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through my body rejecting shittiness of the world. It gets better. Stay in shape. It gets harder the longer you wait. Don't give up on your it gets harder the longer you wait don't give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing my music You're welcome. Nice talking to you. You're welcome.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/481_P/481_AUDIO.wav,1
482,22,1," All right, there you are. That looks good. All right. Okay. Okay. So again, when she says goodbye, just press this button. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Yes. Yes. I'm doing fine. I was born in Texas and I moved to California when I was three and grew up here in California. Yeah. I was. Yes. I've never been back there. Don't have any relatives there. Don't have a reason to go back there. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, my family's here. That's one. The weather's great. The beaches and the mountains are here. All those things are very good. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic, which probably most people say. It's expensive to live here. It was probably the top two. Recently I've traveled. What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Nice! What are your most memorable experiences? I spent most of one day with an Ecuadorian who only speaks Spanish, and I speak very little Spanish. So it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him. I felt like a little kid trying to say, what's this, what's this. It was very humbling. Just seeing that when you're not able to communicate, then that can be very difficult. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Why? What did you study at school? How did you decide to do that? It was, I guess, just kind of circumstances. I needed the work I was doing wasn't providing for the family. And I knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work. And so I pursued that because of the financial gain. It's given me a lot of opportunity. but I don't think it's what I want to do for the rest of my life. Well, I'm actually pursuing becoming a missionary. My wife and I are looking at moving down to Ecuador in the fall for four years. And last year we trained in North Carolina for one year, and that was like theology and Bible training. Basically, God put a desire in my heart to get beyond myself and do something for other people, to go and learn about other people, their culture, and to share the gospel with them. well in my immediate family I'm married I've been married for 10 years this June and we have four daughters and then but I have one older brother no sisters so what what do you want to know about my family I'm really close with my wife and my daughters with my brother I'm not not real close partly because he's mentally handicapped he has the mental capacity of a seven-year-old even though he's five years older than me so just kinda because that dynamic it's hard to have a close relationship with him I am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents Um, I'd say my, my youth pastor in high school, he was a real, real positive influence in me. Can you tell me about that? Um, just, he has a, he has a drive and a zeal for, for pursuing the truth, um, and just, uh, studying the Bible. And because of his influence, that kind of put me on a path to wanting to study the Bible. I think I've gotten better at it. There have been times when I'll get angry and it can just kind of really rule over me, just the frustration. and I'm the type of person that it takes me, usually it takes some time for me to get angry and some time to calm down again. But I've learned over time that really getting angry and keeping that anger in doesn't attack the other person or the thing that I'm angry at. It just kind of attacks me. And so really it's not a good behavior to keep. So when things anger me, I try to talk to the other person and say, you know, this situation is making me upset. I try to kind of talk through it and resolve it and come to a resolution, even more than just compromising, but trying to really resolve the root of the problem. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was the time? Well, a couple weeks ago, or maybe even a month ago, my wife and I were going on a trip with her parents, and her parents had already left. We were just driving down to Orange County area for this trip, and my wife wanted, she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things to be packed, and but hadn't really in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she um you know i didn't meet him according to to what she wanted and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted um and kind of getting attacked for it so so that i i started yelling at her and and we you know we had that conflict but then you know within an hour so we kind of talked through and we had figured out what the cause of that conflict was are you asking the moment of during the conflict very you know just very angry you know you can feel it in your body part partly the I guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that uh if it was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so I would think yeah so initially I felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger I guess it was deciding to go to our training last year. I felt that God had put on my heart that this was something I was supposed to pursue. My wife didn't feel that way. And I just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue. and but at the same time I knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it would kind of fall apart so I kind of relinquished it and I said to her you know I'm not gonna make you go you know if you want to go then then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at doing something else and not going so that was difficult for me because uh you know again that that kind of felt like a loss because I felt deeply that that's what I was supposed to do. But then after I kind of gave that up, then she came to a point where she said, no, I have a piece about doing this, and then we went ahead and pursued it. So just kind of giving it up was difficult for me. Tell me about something bad or something that I can erase from my memory. Oh, let me see. I'm not sure. I don't know. I can't really think of anything very traumatic that I would want to erase. I think good things and bad things, they all kind of shape who we are. And so I can't think of anything that I would want to erase. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Usually it's not too bad. Are you referring to on the questionnaire where I said that I had some trouble sleeping? The job I work, the scheduling has shifted. So lately I've been working some nighttime shifts or graveyard shifts. So coming home in the morning when it's light, then it's been hard for me to sleep. but it was mostly because I was staying up so late because of work. Pretty easy. When I don't sleep, then I do get cranky. I've been feeling good lately. No, not really. No. No. No. Um. I don't know I can't think of anything that was kind of out of the ordinary but yesterday we my wife and I took took our our three younger girls We took them to the park. The oldest one stayed with her grandma. But we took them to the park, and they played. And, yeah, so those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park. That's so good to hear. How are your best friends? I think you'd say I'm a family man. that I'm dependable, that he can count on me. Usually my friend, I end up doing different work around the house for him because I'm kind of a handyman. So in that way, I think you'd say I'm kind of dependable or someone he could go to for advice. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I guess I would like to be able to start conversations with people easier. Sometimes I have trouble just talking to people, especially if they're in a group. If people are one-on-one, then it's usually easier for me to talk to them. But kind of talking to people in a group, I wish I was a little better at that. Now, if it's ??????????????What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Okay. What I was going to say right before that was that if I'm giving a speech or something to a large group, I don't really have a problem with that. But if it's more interaction type thing, then that's kind ould give to myself 10 or 20 years ago probably would have been to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life that's about it I think that would have made the biggest difference in my life I think What are you most proud of in your life? Hope kind of through them that I can, you know, leave something worthwhile. You're welcome. Goodbye. Alright. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/482_P/482_AUDIO.wav,0
483,52,2," Okay, that looks good. Okay, when she says goodbye, you're just going to press this button and I'll come back over. Okay? So she'll start asking you questions. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions, but let's start with you. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are completely confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? Hmm. Good, I guess. That's good. Where are you from originally? New Orleans, Louisiana. Really? When did you go away? 2005. How often do you go back to your hometown? I used to go back often, but not much anymore. Why? Just things happened. Okay. Why did you go away? Um, well, I guess you're not programmed with this knowledge, but Katrina happened in 2005. Wow. How easy was it for you to get used to it in the end? Not really. Can you tell me about that? Where to begin? Just LA is different culturally. I have a different culture out here. It's just a different place. What are some things you really like about LA? It's bike friendly. Louisiana isn't. New Orleans for that matter really isn't. Now they're trying to be, but it just isn't that successful. What are some things you know really like about the way? I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Why? I don't have a lot of money, kind of broke. Just being able to go on an adventure. Let's see. I once went to Comic-Con on a bicycle, like a three-wheel bike. And that was pretty fun. kind of scary and dangerous nearly got killed it was scary traveling or just in general hmm um I gotta say... I gotta say we were heading out of... We were heading off the PCH and going into Laguna. And Laguna has this really steep hill. And on Sundays it's full of traffic. and I remember going down the the hill and my brakes weren't working and I was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click and I was like oh god and I'm on a three-wheel bike so I'm larger than most bikes and I'm like zipping in between like gridlocked traffic going down a hill unable to brake and I'm going down and suddenly there's this car that veers right into essentially where I'm trying to go so I turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic and then looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes and like not managing to keep my bike from rolling which is painful when your bike rolls kind of hurts a lot so yeah yeah that's it What did you study at school? Various different things. Anthropology, visual effects, kind of weird, but yeah. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I've always had a fascination with film, and I think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating just as like the mob mentality of people especially dream job um huh I have no idea just a job I guess Why are you outgoing? Why? So being outgoing just doesn't really affect me. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I play video games, listen to music. Um, yeah. Read books. I like reading books. And drawing. Reading books, drawing, playing video games. Did I forget anything? Sleeping. I like sleeping. That's fun. Uh, not good. Frequently. Can you tell me about that? Um. Uh. In high school, I shoved somebody's head through a locker. Um. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's not good. Don't ever shove someone's head into a locker. That's a great way to get suspended. Um. I don't know. Yeah, things like that. Just getting into fights. Like a serious argument? I guess like this argument over over I guess over like like viewpoints on like gun control and gun control laws. I mean, it was like yesterday evening. It was, it was an argument about, you know, gun control regulation. I mean, it doesn't really affect me personally, but that was like the last argument I got into. That's kind of what you specified, I think. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Ooh. Um. My entire life. Um. Uh. Um. Yeah, um, about two years ago, I broke up with, like, as everyone calls her, my evil ex. And, um, yeah, it was just, it was bad. The whole thing went down bad. I mean, I think I've calmed down a lot since then, like, just as a person, as a whole, but, I mean, I was angry and stuff. I think I, like, went riding my bike for, like, hundreds plus miles in a singular day, and I was in a ton of pain. And, like, later in the evening I got home and I was like, oh, God. Like, I could barely walk. And, yeah, I think running off and, like, going on, like, extreme cycling spree was not good. But it was better than, like, eating too much and, like, just overeating because I was depressed. But, yeah, like, we fought and screamed and it was not good. Like, we didn't physically fight. It was more like a screaming match of death. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. I don't think I've had a singular hard decision I've ever had to make. because my my biggest thing in life is don't you know don't regret don't regret the the things you do just regret the opportunities you've missed and that's like had to come with me that's like had to I've had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago I totally just could not grasp that concept and to answer your question I think thinking about it the hardest decision I've had to make is I'd say probably probably to break up with my ex. Probably. Probably. Um. Ooh. Um. Where do I begin? Um. My ex was not a good person, just in any way shape or form of the word. She did some things that I wasn't entirely comfortable with, just to the people around her and to me. And I... You know, they say you're supposed to forgive people for making mistakes or doing things. And I just, I think there's some things you can't forgive people for, no matter how hard you try. And I think there's some things that once done... they can't be undone they just they're they're the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i like i just the things just fell apart after that it just we despite us trying it just it didn't work out i mean i i don't know i don't really want to talk about exactly what happened oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening um huh i don't you know that's hard um um katrina just the experience of katrina for starters um my ex i guess between those those two. It's kind of hard. I'd actually rather lean towards Katrina because that was just, that was not, I mean I guess you don't exactly know about it but in 2005 this giant storm hit New Orleans, Louisiana, killed a whole bunch of people, leveled the town, and I lost a lot of friends during the storm. I mean I'm kind of, I'm getting over it, but it's still, it's still there. And I think, I don't know, I mean, you can try and look at, you can try your best to try and find something positive in that. But there's just, there's nothing. The only thing you can do is just think that was like a freak accident and it will never happen again. So, I live in LA and, you know, earthquakes, they can happen. I just think, oh, I'd rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? How long ago were you diagnosed? Which would have been... 10... Well, between 10 and 12 years ago. I don't know. Whenever I was in the 6th grade. That's when I was first told that I was depressed. As far as PTSD goes... Degos. Um, post-Katrina. Um, and then, you know, just post-Katrina mostly. That was the big thing. um i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school it kind of wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kind of got into my high school and they were like here's help because we know you're gonna need it um and i was like oh well thanks I didn't really ask for it but okay I'll take it you know just kind of happened no not not anymore Um... That's a good question! Um... Uh... Geez. You know, I really don't know. I guess it just kind of stopped. Just kind of was like, I'm not going to do this anymore. Sometimes. Sometimes it's a lot of like, how are you feeling today and stuff and you know, it's kind of, well, I'm feeling fine right now, but ask me in two hours and who knows, you know. um i guess it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen and to just get on and move along with your life essentially just like carry on you know things will happen carry on yeah tell me about the last time you felt really happy um wow um uh I was um I was Just hanging out with my girlfriend. Just hanging out. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, for starters, I mean, you can't see when I walked in, but I'm walking with a cane right now because I got hit by a car recently. and uh i'd make my leg better um let's see cane's over there that way but anyway um i don't know um make myself less fat um i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day um because when you sleep like more than 10 hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that i have to sleep like 12 hours to feel good like you can sleep six you know like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with seven or eight you know like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours it's just i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too i mean yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much okay how are your best friends um Um, um, utterly insane in a good way. Utterly insane in a good way. Um, I guess, like, they would also say, like, you know, there are times where I might seem like an asshole and I'm not really an asshole I just you know I just have issues like everybody else specifically I have Asperger's so that's a form of autism that just kind of makes life awesome they'd also say I'm flamboyant eccentric because I totally am I just I don't know I figure I'm still alive so I should live because I'm still alive and you know who knows how long I'm gonna be alive for so I should you know live while I'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not sit and be calm. Except when I'm reading. And I like reading. Okay. What advice would you give yourself ten or twelve years ago? um uh stop fucking up um no that's kind of messed up um i think i would have told myself at the time um because i i've known my my evil ex I've known her since like I was like six and she was five I think 10 years ago I would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted and more importantly don't Don't let your guard down around her because she'll exploit that. And I mean like physically let your guard down, not mentally. Yeah, don't date her. Just don't do it. It's not worth it. It's not worth the trouble. It's not worth the pain. It's not worth it. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't really feel pride. I'm just... it's more of like the fact that I'm still alive. I'm proud to be alive. I don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. Who knows? Do I press the button now? Oh, bye! Okay. By the way, her eyes are really creepy. Just saying that. They have an uncanny vision.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/483_P/483_AUDIO.wav,2
484,31,1," Okay, that looks great. Okay, so again, once she's done, she'll say goodbye. You just press this button and it'll come back in. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm a student from New Jersey. I'm just here to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions, but let's start. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. Okay. Where are you from and where are you from? I was born in Oakland. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? All the different areas of the city, the different cultures that are here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic, the lack of public transportation, and the superficiality. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? Being able to experience a different way of living, getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective. What was your role in the first? In 2008, I studied abroad in Brazil and that was about four months. And I was in Bahia, which is in the north. And the program consisted of learning the history, learning the language, and staying with a homestay family. Nice. What made you decide to do that? I've always wanted to travel, and I chose Brazil because they have an Afro-Brazilian population or a large Afro-Brazilian population, which I really wanted to learn more about. And I think the history and the culture is really interesting. I think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go. Yeah. What do you study at school? What's your dream job? different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel, basically that those would be the main characteristics. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think that's a false dichotomy, but I do consider myself shy, but at the same time time outgoing in the sense that I push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and I'm determined to do what it takes to become successful. That makes sense. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not blind, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I listen to music and just lay on my bed and I guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things. Also breathing exercises, which I'm learning more about, as well as exercise. How are you at consuming your temper? Pretty good. I don't get angry a lot. So as far as angry temperament, I'm pretty good at that. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? hmm um what month is this may probably two months ago and i argued via text message so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you'd call it arguing in a sense over whether or not I should be forgiven for something that I thought was minor with a friend I've had for a few years. How did you feel in that moment? I felt anxious, sad, and angry. Yeah, those are the main emotions. How do you know them? I know them because I think I'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them. And then I'll notice the physical manifestations of emotions like if my heart's racing or if I'm getting sweaty. If my breathing is more shallow, I'll know I'm anxious. I'll know something's bothering me. me. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. Hmm. That I wish I had handled differently. I guess related to this argument, I went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and I know that it wasn't such a big deal but I wish I hadn't have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and I also felt really bad about what I did. Hardest decision? Wow. Probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into I briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards well after dropping out I had to really rethink what it is that I wanted to do and what I wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for it's been a lot of energy on How did you decide to do that? That makes sense. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh. Revolving around the same person I spoke of earlier, it was a dating relationship, and a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me, and it involved another person, and I wish I could get that out of my mind. I have a pretty good relationship with my mom. She lives in the Bay Area. I didn't grow up with her, but I've gotten closer to her as an adult. we talk pretty regularly with my dad I grew up with him mostly he lives in Atlanta and we don't talk as much but we are we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that contentious or anything and I'm an only child so I don't have siblings I don't have a large family So, in general, I'm not really that close to family. One person is my mentor who I met in 2005. And she's a judge. And I met her when I was in community college. and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that I would be able to achieve certain things. That's great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. Well, it's easy for me to sleep. What's not easy is getting up. Why? Because usually I do not look forward to what I have to do that day and the thought of it is, you know, just makes me want to stay in bed. Also, I wake up pretty tired and not really feeling refreshed. How do you sleep? How do you sleep? I think just self-talk about how what I have to do isn't that bad or that the things that I'm doing now are going to end pretty soon with the end of the school year. Trying to think of things that I can look forward to in the week. Also listening to music and browsing the internet kind of gets my mind going feeling feeling emotionally drained in some ways and at the same time feeling like I've accomplished a lot and then I've grown So a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time. Have you ever been diagnosed with dyslexia? No, I haven't. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? In 2006. What taught you to sleep well? The convergence of a lot of stressful factors. I was out of touch with my mom. I started, well I transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really exacerbated things that were already there, depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where I just felt really overwhelmed. Yes, I do. Yes. I notice I'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them I'm able to think differently about things that happen maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas I need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. This past weekend, I reconnected with some old friends, and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again. Awesome. How would your best friend describe you? um people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very um analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual I wish that I did not or wait I wish I was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which I'm working on and I wish that I had more energy start going to therapy now um but yeah I really would and also to wait how old am I 28 10 years ago 18 Okay, so graduating from high school, I would tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that I wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to do as a career. Okay. What are your most proud of in your life? I think the fact that I'm in grad school and coming from the background that I come from, low socioeconomic status, and just pushing through challenges to get here. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/484_P/484_AUDIO.wav,1
485,21,1," I may have you just stand briefly so I can speak back just a little bit. Sure. Okay, so you can see there. There we go. All right. Okay, great. So again, once she says goodbye, you're going to press this button and I'll come back in for you. Okay, sure. Thank you. Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? That's good. Where are you from originally? Really? When did you move to LA? How often do you go back to your hometown? How does it compare to LA? Why did you move to LA? How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Can you tell me about that? What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you really like about LA? I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Why? Okay. What did you study at school? That sounds interesting. What did you decide to do? so I just like making people happy and it's kind of easy to do that with games. Uh, work for myself, make my own games, and write my own paychecks, I guess. Uh, pretty hard. I've been trying to do it for the past couple years. It's a little difficult. I see. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess I'm kinda shy. It depends on the people and the environment, I guess. Uh, play guitar, listen to some music, talk to friends. How are you at controlling your temper? That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? What's something you feel guilty about? being guilty. Hmm. Don't know. Can't really think of anything. Leaving St. Louis was one of them because all my friends and family were there. What made you decide to do that? Uh, I guess the benefits outweighed, you know, the cons. Mm-hmm. Are you happy you did that? Definitely. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Uh, maybe getting kicked out of high school the first time. Can you tell me about that? I ended up getting myself and my friends in trouble and it was just no good. You kind of look back on it and I guess that's something from my past I wish I would have done different. Have you done anything to avoid it? Followed the rules I guess. Just been a good student would have helped. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Not really that close with my family. I've got a small family anyway and when I was in St. Louis we'd see each other a couple times a year but that's really it so no strong ties. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I guess most of my friends. They're always there to support me and encourage me and help me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'd say pretty easy. Every once in a while, there's a night I can't sleep, but it's pretty rare. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just tired, groggy. I guess my mind's unfocused and the day goes by a heck of a lot longer. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. not really much to say maybe a little bit more depressed because I'm away from most of my friends and family but nothing unmanageable just try to talk to him when I can think about something else think about happy times no no I guess on the drive out here because it was such a new experience and so exhilarating I think graduating college because I was really proud of myself and really looking forward to the future just I guess kind of euphoria you standing there it seemed kind of surreal funny caring nice guy easily along with pretty happy being me I guess Is there anything you regret? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Keep thinking about what you do before you do it. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. On the computer playing video games with friends. What are some things that visually put you in a good mood? Music. And my friends, I guess. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I guess my determination and my passion for my creativity. Bye. All right. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/485_P/485_AUDIO.wav,0
486,28,1," All righty. Okay, great. Yes. I feel great. I am from St. Louis, Missouri, born and raised. Yes. I've been here a couple times. I just recently moved back two months ago. St. Louis is quite slower. Why do you look for a way? To take care of a good friend who's ill. I'm sorry. Thank you. How easy was it for you to get used to living in a way? I jumped right back on the bandwagon. What are some things you really like about a way? The climate and the restaurants. What are some things you don't really like about a way? the dirt and the traffic. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yes, I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? The road maps, following a road map, maybe driving myself. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, we just recently got back from Colorado. Went up into the mountains, saw the snow, and enjoyed a little fine dining. In Colorado? Actually going horseback riding through the Royal Gorge. Yes, it was. I would be more outgoing. Why? I'm a people person. I understand. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I listen to jazz music, and I also draw. That's great. How do you do it controlling your temper? I've probably mastered controlling my temper through age. It would have been my husband, and it was about financial issues. Unsure, unstable. I don't like loud talking or loud emotion. I like to sit and methodically and logically talk about things. not raise my voice. Most recently, with the illness of my friend, I wish I would have handled his sister a little differently as far as things that she's wanted me to do that I really needed to tell her otherwise. the way they really needed to be done. I took her advice where I shouldn't have. How do you know them? I was engaged to him 15 years ago, and he recently called me, I guess about five years ago, and told me he was diagnosed with cancer. We've always maintained our friendship, and I asked my husband if I could go help him in his time of need, and I'm here. It has been. A lot of things. One, he's a good friend of mine, and his sister moved out here as well. Two, my son wanted to start his career out here. Three, I love the weather. And that's all I can think of at the moment. I would be the death of my youngest son. I don't know where to start as far as he was born premature. and since he was born so early, I had him in five months versus nine, we made the decision to take him off life support because he wasn't getting any better. So that would have been the hardest decision I made with my husband. Mm-hmm. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could have done. I really don't want to erase anything from my memory. I have actually learned and experienced and gained knowledge from things that happened. So I'm not one to put things, erase things out of my mind. I categorize them and place them in memories. that's very close lost my mother at a young age and all of us siblings and my father still remain very close my father Can you tell me about that? Oh, he's very health conscious, very energetic in exercises, and has a spirituality about him that I want to have as well. It's a contentment that he portrays that I would like to have as well. How easy is it for you to get a good next week? No problem. What are you like when you go to sleep well? How have you been feeling lately? Have you had a standard of sleep? Do you have a regular or a doctor's appointment? No, not lately. No, I have not. No, I have not. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I had just got back from a concert, so it was outside, it was enjoyable music, I was with good friends, we ate well and enjoyed the moment. That sounds like a great situation. How would your best friend describe you? As a giving, spiritual, normal person. I don't know. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I can't think of anything that I want to change except for maybe exercise a little more. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. I can't recall one offhand. Okay. Is that anything they wrote? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To have saved more money and to not try and accomplish everything at once. What did you study at school? I started out in cosmetology. Then I went into college. I have some college in mathematics and finance. What's your dream job? Traveling. Okay. Tell me about something you've recently really enjoyed. I like to enjoy good food, nice wine, and company. I just went last night to a very nice Italian restaurant and was in the company of good friends and family. We dined and talked, and that was fun. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of? I guess it would be my children. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye-bye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/486_P/486_AUDIO.wav,0
487,17,1," Oh, my hair is all messy. So, again, she's going to start up in just a couple seconds after I leave. And then, again, when she says goodbye, press this button and I'll come back over, okay? Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm fine, thank you. That's good. Where are you from originally? Detroit, Michigan. Really? Yes. When did you move to L.A.? I moved to L.A. myself in 2007, but my family came here many more years ago, more like 40 years ago. How often do you go back to your hometown? I don't go back to Detroit anymore. Why? I really don't like the weather and I really don't have any reason to. Most of my immediate family is out here in California. What does it compare to LA? different. For me, Detroit was just very cold. It wasn't the best for my personality. I prefer LA, more open space, a warmer climate, warmer people, just a different vibe that I like better. After my husband and I relationship ended, I had family out here, so I thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places I had lived or to stay where we were at. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Extremely easy. I came out here every year to visit while I was in college, so I was extremely used to it. Plus, I had also taken six months off of school and lived out here and went to school out here, so I was completely used to it. Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, like I said, the weather is number one. It's just less crowded. It's more open space. It's a calmer, friendlier vibe. Less rushed. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The smog would be one and when I drive the traffic in certain areas it can be but in general there's not a lot that I don't list. Like I guess the overall threat of earthquake but that isn't really that much of a factor because it rarely happens. The price of real estate. That's another one that I don't necessarily like. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. I can't see your shoes. I can't see your shoes at all. So, I don't travel as much as I used to, but I have traveled worldwide. What do you enjoy about traveling? New experiences. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Well, I used to be an international flight attendant and then later I traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive. So I've traveled a lot of different places and I have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable because, you know, there's different cultures, different things to see, do, learn, enjoy, experience. What's one of your most memorable experiences? My experiences I would say in Europe, visiting more so. I've also visited in South America, I guess because the cultures are so very different. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I would probably say more shy in general compared to people who I know are really, really outgoing, although I've had them describe me as outgoing. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to read. I like to walk or power walk or hike. Listen to music. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm very good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Oh, probably when I was married with my husband many years ago. It could be many things. I don't even know in specific, but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him. It could be a choice of... of the instances when I might have been with him and I you know got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than just you know seeing it is not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be where you were also pushed to answer so you know you can't always just say ignore a person there because many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate, but some people, you know, don't respond to the so-called norm. If you ignore it, they'll just, you know, de-escalate, but that's not always the case. I've taught middle school kids, and you can try calm methods with them, but that doesn't always work, but you always have to, as the teacher, maintain, you know, your professional demeanor, So you can't really, even when the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids. I see what you mean. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, that could be several. Several. I guess the decision in along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so you know that's a pretty hard decision because you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be a very serious outcome for them as well. Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that. Mm-hmm. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh, many different things that could occur, you know, in life. You always are second-guessing things that you might could do, but they also can be learning experiences, so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them, you know, if you can look at it as positive. Sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the impact of the event because there might be something that you can gain from that. But I grew up in a home of dysfunction, so there was domestic abuse, you know, and there were many incidences. So you can't just say only one because there is lots of traumatic things. But it also would have been a different outcome in, say, learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes I see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very, very difficult times dealing with. Right. How do you cope with them? You can listen, you know, and because I understand that not everybody's had the same experience, you know, you can walk them through levels of understanding and, you know, as you know someone, you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that, you know, things will progress in a better way, knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or you know seem to be and of course there's always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here. So that provides us perspective that, you know, can pull someone out of their, I won't necessarily say self-absorption, but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, we have a good relationship. For the most part, there are different levels of stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced, so it has made them interact with life and people more intensely than others. Some have not had as much experience in life that will help them deal with things in a different way so it's always evolving and I walk in positivity as a lead of you know the way I respond to try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Pardon? I didn't hear you. Could you repeat? Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mother, different teachers, friends. Can you tell me about that? Well, my mother has always been a very calm person for the most part, easy going, even though she's experienced a lot of negativity. I've had teachers that have been very positive and proactive and have, you know, taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring. And just various friends that, you know, I would see handling situations sometimes much more difficult you know dealing with things so it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good it depends if I'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know trying to get more hours in the day because I need to get things done then you know it's less but in general I don't have a problem sleeping it's just if I make myself stay stay up because there's more stuff that I want to get done I've been feeling okay less you know stressful in general it goes in general because I've got several projects that I'm working on so but in general good Like, I mean, that in particular. I mean, it just seems less stressful as I get more stuff done. And the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time. But, you know, reorganizing some of the things that need to be done, you know, can smooth that out. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I haven't, but I know it's something that a lot of, say, veterans in particular have, people have. Right. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I have not, no. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. well there's several i guess um and happiness comes in small or large things but in general every every day every every moment to me is i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness um as far as big celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that, I think it's something that should be on your continuum, you know, every day. It can be a really great meal. It could be a great view. It could be, you know, a moment shared with someone, you know, so it should be on an even keel. How do your best friends describe you? As a perseverant, you know, I will continue forth and, and positive, upbeat. maybe not doing things differently when I were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little more differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your kid older you can see you know you could have done some things differently instead of buying the house that I did, I would have, you know, waited and bought another one. I mean, things like that. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I would have made myself move to California sooner, and I would have, instead of buying the house that I bought then, if I'd known I would have, you know, the situation I have now, waited to get something different. But, you know, how can you, you know, have that hindsight? You make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information available, you know, after you have looked at several options. What are you most proud of in your life? of being independent and educated, able to take care of myself. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Bye-bye now. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/487_P/487_AUDIO.wav,1
488,20,1," One second. Okay, so again, when she's done, she'll say goodbye, you'll press this button, and we'll come back over. Okay, sure. Yes. How are you doing today? Fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? San Fernando Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I really like the culture. I love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really. I like to go camping, but I don't really travel. When was the last time that happened? I think it might have been around six months ago I went on a trip with a geology class. Nice! Yeah, it was fun. Hmm. I think it's tough to say. What comes to your mind? Well, I think the first time I went camping was probably really memorable. I went to Death Valley and I got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night. Awesome. What did you study at school? Philosophy. Are you still working on that? Yes. How did you decide to do that? I don't know, I think it just sort of happened. I wanted to be a journalist for a really long time, and then I kind of grew disillusioned with that, and I liked all the different ways, or all the different things I could do with philosophy. That makes sense. What's your dream job? Huh. I don't know, but I really like children and I really like studying their behavior, so I think something along those lines might be it. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm generally pretty outgoing. I tend to be shy around my family, but when I'm around friends and stuff, I think I'm pretty friendly. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? A lot of times I'll watch TV or read. Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? I think I'm pretty good. I don't really get mad. I try to think about other things if I start getting mad or I just start trying to focus on my breathing. The last time I argued with someone, it was probably with my boyfriend, but I'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um i think it was i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate because i wasn't feeling well to begin with. Well, I felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because I just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out. Hmm. I think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother does something wrong I tend to be harsh with him. We're not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I and so he tends to be hostile back and I think that if I were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him. when I was 19 I came home from a party I think around 4am on a Sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of not very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don't live at home I used to be really frustrated with her all the time because she has a really quick temper but I think now that I've got a little bit more distance I can see that she did the best that she could um and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well she's four years younger than me and when when she was around 12 when i was around 16 it was really difficult because she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and i wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my my older little brother who's 15 and I think I got along pretty well with my youngest brother who's 12. One of the first, not the first, but one of my first philosophy professors and I I really loved her classes, and it was really good being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people. That was really motivating since not all my classes were like that. That's great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I think it's pretty easy. I mean, sometimes I'll have trouble going to sleep, but generally it's not that bad. I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Okay. How have you been feeling lately? It's only one class, so I'll have a lot of free time. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not the end of the world if I don't get a job, but I know that I will eventually. So mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much, and I try not to be pessimistic. No. No. Hmm. Well, I think the last time I felt really happy, I went to a party with my boyfriend at the end of the department party, and I knew a couple people there, so I felt comfortable, but I wasn't also able to meet new people. And there were a couple kids there, I spashed around in the pool and I had a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun. That's great. How would your best friend describe you? Um, she would probably say that I'm smart and pretty intellectual. I love to read and to watch really like serious films and TV. And she would probably also say that I'm fun because we like to go out and have fun a lot. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes. So that's a major one that I'm procrastinating. I got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was given 60-some hours of community service, and of course, I procrastinated on doing that, so I had to show up to court again to get an extension, and the judge was very mean, and he didn't seem, I mean, he yelled at me, but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought. It seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech. He gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at, so I understand because that's his job, but it was not great for me because I was really anxious in that situation. well I would have been 12 and 2 um but I think I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents because I think I was a little selfish and self-involved back then I can't really think of anything I mean I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid but everyone does that and um I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn't do so well in school and I got a few W's which I now have to work to get off on my transcript I think so um I think I I wasn't focusing on school at that time and I didn't see any counselors at school or anything so I definitely could have done that okay tell me how you spend your ideal weekend hmm I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping maybe watching a little bit of tv well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up i'm 10 years older than him so and being the oldest i was i was took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and how close we are.

And I wanted blessings and not curses. Tell me about your life or something that you worshiped the most in your life. My marriage.

492,19,1," Get out my ass, Shadow. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ali. I'm a student at the University of Oregon. I'm a student at the University of Oregon. I'm not a therapist, but I'm really learning about people and I love learning about you. I have a few questions for you. I'm a student at the University of Oregon. I'm a student at the University of Oregon. Are you a therapist? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good, thank you. What's your name? Where are you from in the United States? Maryland. Really? Yeah. When did you start out? 85. Yeah. That's a long time. Yeah, it is. A long time. How often do you go back to the U.S.? Not as often as I'd like. Why? Out of work. So, you know, the money issue. What do you mean? How does it compare to LA? Maryland is different. And so the comparison is, the only comparison is that they're both cities, but Maryland has its flavor and LA has its own flavor. So they have unique, you know, characteristics about themselves. I moved to LA because I was living in Hawaii and I was out of money and I just had enough for a plane ticket and come and stay here in a hotel until I found a job, which I did really quickly. But anyway, so that's why I came here. I didn't want to go home. I decided to come here and just start over. I am. I am. It was real easy. Just did it. What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you want to do in the future? I don't like some of the policies with regard to the smoking. I really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets, make it like USC. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a role explorer. Do you follow a lot? No, not outside of getting on the bus and things like that. Okay. What did you study at school? I was studying to be a nurse. That sounds interesting. Yeah. How did you decide to do that? I wanted to have a job that pays well, but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift. So, yeah. Are you still living in that? No, I had to put that on the side and I want to get a business degree now. What's your dream job? My dream job is to create new technology. Can you tell me about that? Other than to say I would like to create something that would change the world, like Steve Jobs with his iPhone. That's good. Yes. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I am, it depends on the situation, but I'm more outgoing. I do tend towards a little shyness from time to time. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I can always go to the screen for you. I know it's not Hawaii, but it's a bad news guy. What do you do in your life? What I do is I'll go to the movies. When was the last time you were in a movie? I went to the movies probably like maybe five weeks ago. Yeah. Okay. When was the last time you were in a movie? When was it about? Well, I had an argument recently, not really an argument, but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular department that I'm in. And it's a volunteer position. I use my administrative assistant, more executive assistant skills to, I do minutes for meetings that I cover. And so then I have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that. And this person is micromanaging me, but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting. So the meeting should have been comprised of 100 people, but we have like maybe 30. No, it wasn't even 30, 20. Yes. So now she doesn't know that I realized, you know, that part of it. So there was a little bit of a argument and but again, not an argument, but a disagreement. And when we talk again, I will point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect. and the energy she's investing in me is unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve. Doesn't that sound good? Yeah. Yeah. Well, a little attacked, you know, so. It depends on, I'm very good at controlling my temper. It's, you know, there are places where you can allow your temper to come out, even though it might not be appropriate. And then there are other places where if it comes out, then you shot yourself in the foot. So I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. Yeah. How many other situations have you received a moment of discipline? I don't have any situation recent that I can think of. Probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor, just ignore the neighbor altogether. So I wish I had done that differently. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Yeah. Hmm. Thankfully, I've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. I have what I do in my life and in my going forward. Everything that I've done and everything that has happened, I accept it as something that has to be to get me to go forward. I am a born-again Christian, And so I know that God is sovereign over my life. And also that according to his word, the Bible says that every day of our life is written in his book. So events and circumstances, I feel they are ordained by God. Now, obviously, I'm not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous. but I feel that things that have happened, even if I've dealt with them the wrong way, it's God's, his total sovereignty has control over that, and it will work for my good. So that's how I feel. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have all brothers and so I'm not really that close with my brothers and my mother say that again people that I've grown up with neighbors from when I when I was younger that I was close to, different friends that I've had along the way, friends who are more like family. So yeah, they've had positive influence. How do you usually get sleep in the day and not sleep? I sleep too well. So I sleep well every night. How do you do that? normal but I my normal I've been feeling my normal No. No. No. No. That was recent. Something happened. And I was able to participate with my church on Sunday. I was at Pentecost. It was Pentecost Sunday, meaning it was 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And so I was able to participate in our prayer session that we had at my church. And that was really, made me very happy. That's really good to hear. How do you best understand yourself? That I'm smart. They would say that I'm smart, that I handle difficulties very well, and that I dress well. What are some things in the world you continue to value so? Um, I don't want to change anything. I do want to just be a better me. So be a better person. So I am working on listening better, communicating better, and accepting my weaknesses better as well as my strengths. Okay. Is it moving your way? No. What advice would you give to a person who is not a Christian? That's a good question. I would have told myself to do what I know to do, to do what I know, that which is right, and to do what I know is right and let everything else, let the other chips fall where they may, but to do what I know to do is right and to go forward. What are your thoughts on the matter? I am very proud of the fact that I don't give up okay I think that's everything I need to say thank you for sharing your thoughts with me bye bye bye and thank you see y'all Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/492_P/492_AUDIO.wav,0

Yes. it's a place to discuss my problems and learn solutions on how to deal with them yes ways to deal with my problems and how to cope with things I'm more positive about things now. before I was much more introverted and I didn't like to discuss I was never comfortable I was never comfortable discussing my problems with people and by going to a therapist it has allowed me to trust people to discuss my problems very good no No major changes. Yep. No, I do not. How easy is it to be awake and asleep? Easy I don't have any problems going to sleep. What are you like in the morning? Cranky, I don't like to be around people.

Yes, I am. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling fine. Thanks for asking. Awesome. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from California born and raised and I live in Carson at the moment I love the beaches the Sun and the amusement parks the traffic LA traffic is hectic. Um, nah, not really. I read and I listen to soft music like jazz or something I don't like people to walk in front of me don't say excuse me cut me off in traffic when I'm driving I don't like a tailgater little small small comments like small remarks that people may make that may upset me I just don't like to be I'm easily aggravated so I don't like to be aggravated What do you do when you're annoyed? How are you controlling your temper? I'm pretty good at controlling it sometimes, but at times I can get very irate, so I'm working on that right now. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Um, well, I haven't argued in almost a year, but when I did, it was over a girl. It was my ex-boyfriend. It was over a female, but it's over now, so I haven't had any real arguments since almost a year. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied, um, in college, I did, um, child development, and I also studied computer science. What do you do now? Right now, I'm a homemaker. I don't work at all. I haven't been working in about three months now. I was laid off, but I was doing receptionist work. So I'm currently looking for employment at this moment. That's great. What's your dream job? My dream job is to own my own design graphics computer shop, which means when you graphic your designs online, and you send them to different distributors. And what they do is they approve or disapprove what they like or dislike about my designs. If they want to go ahead with it, they'll buy them from me, and then they'll go from there. Really? Do you travel a lot? No. I used to in the past, but not at the moment. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When I went to Hawaii with my daughter and my mom, it was very delightful. We stayed for almost two weeks, and it was not even two years ago. It was very, very nice, and I wish I can go back. The beaches were beautiful. The food was great. The luau's were great at night. It was really, really nice, a great experience. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. My mother and my daughter, we're all three. We're like sisters. We couldn't be any closer. My parents, my grandparents who have now gone, they're past, but they were a very positive influence in my life. My guy friend that I'm dating now, he's very positive in my life, so I have a lot of backbone support, you can say. I don't right now because I'm living with my mother and stepdad. I'm trying to move someplace on my own now but it's kind of hard not working at all so I just have to wing it out until I can do better no it's just myself my daughter my mom and my stepdad at the moment No, I haven't. Yes, I have. Almost two years now. no I had no idea um just always feeling down and out clinging myself in not wanting to be bothered with other the outside world just little mood swings and just can't sleep at night all kind of little stuff that kind of got me feeling like something wasn't right about me Yes, I do. Yes, I do. It's very useful. It is, very much so. Tell me more about that. The reason why I feel like it's helping me is because the lady who I see there at the therapy place, she's very nice. She's willing to help out in any way she can. She's almost to me like a psychiatrist. She's very good. I mean, she talks to me about things, encourages me to what not to do, what to do to help calm down, to feel better. And she's just very nice, all in all. I always leave there confident all the time. What sort of changes have you noticed in your life? Number one, my mood swings. I've noticed a big change in that and my attitude. Okay. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It affected me in a great way. I would never say negative because, like I said, it goes back to the helpfulness that I've received from the lady and from the therapist and the different ways I was coached on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem that I do have right now I suffer with. So that's how it affected me that way. Okay. What were your symptoms? The attitudes, the mood swings, couldn't sleep at night, depressed all the time, no outside company at all, didn't want to be bothered with anybody, friends or family, locked up in my room all the time um halfway not wanting to eat or overeating it was just a lot um maybe like any little thing would trigger me off like somebody could say something wrong to me that i would think was wrong and would just trigger i would just get triggered and just snap for no reason it's just i don't know what what cost it besides that That's great. How do you cope with that? Well, now I'm coping with it by not snapping as much and just trying to stay calm. I just need a lot of positive environment around me, not negativity. That helps too. So with that being said, I just kind of maintain and keep my high self-esteem up as much as I can. Nice. How have you been feeling lately? A lot better than before. That's good. Have you ever seen yourself in a very positive way? Yes, I have. Very positive thoughts. Very positive behavior. Much better than what it was. very big improvement from before. Do you feel that way often? Yes, I have been for the past few months. I've been feeling a little better. Do you feel down? I have at times, but today, no. I'm feeling pretty upbeat. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's not very easy, but I try. But for the past few nights, I have been sleeping the full night, so that's a positive for me. What do you like from the most before? Very cranky, very groggy, moody. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Actually yesterday I received some good news over the phone and I was happy the whole day. I'm still kind of happy about it today too. So that was very good for me. My best friend is a male. He would probably describe me as upbeat, always ready to go love to eat just a fun person to be around no I don't regret anything thank you for having me Bye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/602_P/602_AUDIO.wav,1
603,29,1," Hello. Hello. She seems nice. Okay. Not really 510. Okay. Okay. When she says goodbye. When she says goodbye. Okay. Great. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm alright. A little tired. Awesome. Where are you from and where are you from? I grew up just outside of Philadelphia, and I moved to Los Angeles almost five years ago. Nice. What are some things you really like about LA? Weather, for sure. Also, I was a film major and business minor in school, so I came out to be involved in entertainment. What are some things you don't really like about LA? traffic, smog, some of the people are a little flaky, but I generally like LA. No, quite the opposite. I consider myself an extrovert. I enjoy reading, you know, glass of wine perhaps, throw on an old movie, try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk, something like that. cruelty. People not using their, people being careless or thoughtless, you know, not really giving consideration to other people when they do things. Usually vocalize my annoyance, like unless I figure it would be really inappropriate in the moment, but I'll usually let somebody know as gently as possible that I'm kind of annoyed with what's going on. How are you at controlling the fuses? Usually pretty good, but I also, you know, there's like a limit point where I go past and it's like, then I cannot control it really anymore. So I have a long fuse, but kind of a large amount of dynamite there sometimes. I had an argument with my girlfriend recently, and it was, you know, we have very different communication styles. So I guess I was not feeling heard and she was not feeling like my response was appropriate at the time maybe. Okay. What did you study at school? I was a film and media arts major and business minor. And I actually got my master's of business administration at What do you do now? Okay. What's your dream job? major and I did a couple of internships for production companies as an undergrad and in in my master's program and you know I like working with creative people and developing stories and developing projects and being the person that can go from the business and legal people to the creative people and try to make everyone happy and make some money. I try to. I mean, I'm a little low on funds right now, but I really enjoy traveling. I drove cross-country when I moved from Philadelphia to L.A., so I drove down the east coast to Savannah, and then all through the south and the southwest. I've been to England four times. I've been to continental Europe twice. A lot of the islands, Montreal, that's the only place I've been to in Canada, But there's a lot more of the U.S. and also Asia, Africa, Australia, those places I've not been to yet, but I'd love to go. I would say maybe the first time I ever left the country, first time I ever went to Europe, We got to take the train, the Glacier Express, through the Alps in Switzerland. And it was unbelievable with the snow and things like that. And I took a lot of pictures. And I don't know, it's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. So it really sticks out in my mind. I'm very close with my parents. I talk with my mom on the phone probably two or three times a week I just talked to my father for Father's Day the other day and he sends me emails of news things that he found interesting or stuff that's related to film and things like that I'm close with my sister, I have a niece and a nephew I'm very close with them, I talk to my sister a decent amount and I always see them when I'm home for the holidays but they're all in the Philadelphia area so I'm not physically around them only maybe once a year twice at the most if there's a wedding or something like that there been a lot definitely my parents some of my teachers in high school that sort of encouraged me. Like my social studies, like world cultures professor, one of my English teachers. My film program, I did a summer internship program twice and they had one of the professors from my film 101 class was the moderator for that, so I kept in touch with him as well. I like it a lot better now. My last roommate was only, he was somebody from the MBA program, also was a year behind me, and he was just a terrible roommate. He just moved out, so I was replaced by somebody else who was young and nice, and he has the money for rent, and he has a rabbit, and he's just, like, he's a pretty cool guy. So I've got a decent-sized place. I've got the bigger bedroom of the two, and the rent is not too bad, and I get to live, like, in the Culver City Mar Vista, side of town which I really enjoy. So I like where I live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood, not at all. But I'm a little broke right now. So I've got to get back working again and calm down the money situation. But the living situation itself is fine. Okay. Do you have roommates? I have one roommate, yes. Nice guy. No, I have not. No. Yes. Well, I mean, I guess in college I was seeing a cognitive therapist for a while, but I was never on medication or anything like that, and I kind of got away from it. But last summer, probably about a year ago, I kind of came back, and I was seeing the individual counselor at school. I was doing group counseling sessions, and they had me on Welbutrin also. So I guess a year. Yes. I had a DUI, which, you know, all of my drinking, I think, was really predicated more upon the depression and not being able to handle that properly. So that was part of it, and then the stress of school, you know, was having problems there, having problems in my relationship, and, you know, it was at a really low point, and I felt terrible, so I decided I should probably do whatever I could do in order to get better. Okay. Do you still go to therapy now? No, I took a leave of absence from school, so that's not really available to me, but I still go to a sobriety support group, and going back to school is a possibility, so I might go back to doing the counseling sessions there. But my health insurance runs out in like two months, so I don't really have... I won't really have a way to see someone unless I see someone from the Department of Health or something like that. So we'll see. Okay. Do you feel like there are people? I do. I definitely think that there are people that are probably on medication that are not in therapy that probably should be. I'd rather do therapy without medication than medication without therapy, that is for sure. So I definitely think it's a positive to speak with somebody on a regular basis who is sort of removed from your life and objective about it and, you know, just listen. That's really the most important part is having somebody to listen. Okay. Is going to be very important? Yeah, I would definitely say it was. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I mean, just having dedicated time of like an hour or so, you know, 50 minutes, whatever, to where somebody gets to listen to what's going on with you and offer some possible guidance in that direction, you know, in the direction you want to go, I think is always positive. And it forces you to be, like, more mindful of what's actually bothering yourself when you have to vocalize it and when you have to look them in the eye and tell them what you're feeling and try to help figure out why and what you can do about it. I think that's always a good thing. What sort of changes have you noticed in your life? all the stuff that it should be should have been doing before but wasn't I'm just generally improve the mood I wasn't drinking often but when I was I was drinking to get drunk I was very I I was very down. There was some weight gain. I was sleeping a lot. I just wasn't enjoying the things I used to enjoy as much. I was worried about money. I was worried about what direction my life was headed, which I still am to an extent, but it's not bringing me down so much now. I was just caught up in a down period, like a rut that I couldn't get out of. I think it was probably just not feeling successful in the things that I wanted to do and kind of just got swept up in the day-to-day of like, oh, well, I need to be in school because I don't have a job and I don't have any money and I'm trying to figure it out and I'll do this internship and that's not going to really lead to anything. And it was just a very, you know, I wasn't moving anywhere. I was stuck in one spot and I didn't like that. Well, I'm not drinking. Not like that anyway. I try to be a little bit more mindful of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. If I end up back in school again, I'm going to definitely take up the counseling again and the group sessions again. I don't know if I want to be back on medication. I felt like that was good for the time frame that it was in, but I don't want to have to take something every day in order to feel good. I'm trying to get back in shape now. I joined the local gym, and I figure that's going to help me too. But the main thing is going to be figuring out what to do with my life, because I'm 30 now, so I feel like it's time to get the real career started. Nice. How have you been doing lately? I've been okay. Just really worried about the money situation because I don't have the student loans to fall back on anymore and stuff, so I'm pretty broke, hence doing a virtual reality study. But when I get that sorted out and I'm on a regular schedule again and I'm doing something where I'm secure financially here, then I'm sure I will feel a lot better and I will be excited again. How do you understand the use of everything here? Definitely. Yeah, most of the time. Tell me more about that. Well, like I said, I do get upset about things. I'm not somebody who likes to keep things inside. But even getting them out in the past wouldn't really get me through them. You know, it would be something I'd really have to slog through, and it would take me, you know, it would pull me down for sure. But now I feel a little bit more comfortable with feeling what I'm feeling and getting it out and then trying to work through it. Some days I do, you know, but it's not every day and it's not like for no particular reason anymore. I mean, I might be down because I'm stressed out because I have a problem that, you know, I need to address in life, like my lack of funds right now. and, you know, trying to get in back shape and, you know, trying to figure out what to do with my education that I have so far and find what I want to do, like, that's something that people should be worried about. But I don't feel like it's any anxiety or anything like that is, you know, or sadness or fear is dominating anymore. How easy is it to wake up early and sleep? being sleepless or anything like that. There are definitely some days where I feel like staying in bed sometimes, but physically I feel okay. What are your lessons in sleep life? That sucks. I mean, I definitely, I almost feel like I have, like, cold symptoms. If I only get four or five hours of sleep or something like that, I will, you know, I'll have a runny nose, I'll feel a little feverish, I'll be hungry at weird times, Sometimes I'll just be very run down and I don't like that feeling at all. I try to get like 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? that was a fun occasion as well i would say very intelligent very funny uh... a little intense a little bit crazy nobody loyal also generally a good person a nice person i regret a lot of things in my life i've done some The DUI, definitely regret that. I dropped out of the first college that I went to because things were really going badly for me at that time. I mean, I kind of regret that. I think it might have been the right thing to do, but it would have been nice to be able to finish school on time and start a career that way. I generally try to behave the way I would feel comfortable sleeping at night afterward, but everybody fails at something. So anytime I've lied, anytime I've quit something, anytime I've felt like I've wasted an opportunity. I regret those things like most people do. Okay, I think that's all. Thank you for your time. You're welcome. Bye. She's inquisitive.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/603_P/603_AUDIO.wav,0

Do you consider yourself an introvert? Why? so much and I tend to be very reserved and not really forthcoming about my feelings etc Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I'm not sure I understand the question exactly, but I... I can't really say, I just retreat within myself and I don't tend to express what I'm thinking or feeling. If that makes sense. Say again? Say again please? What do you do when you're in the office? What do I do when I'm alone? I ride a bicycle a lot. I ride a bicycle everywhere. I'm a bicycle commuter. And I also, like when I'm alone, like on the bus, I'll read, I'll bring a book with me and I'll read a lot. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm very good at controlling my temper. I don't, um, I mean, I'm so good at repressing my feelings that, um, I very rarely express, I mean, I don't know, I don't really express anger. Also, I don't really feel anger because I, um, I'm not an angry person. I, um, I may be very disappointed when something bad happens, but I won't erupt in a rage. I don't really feel rage. But I'm sort of exposed to it all the time on the road. I see people yelling at each other and screaming. And so it's... Yeah, I sort of cultivate my serenity. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time I argued with someone... it would have been a job related argument and what did I study in school I started English American literature What do you do now? That sucks. It can be tough to find a good job these days. What's your dream job? Really? Yeah, yeah. Travel a lot? Travel a lot? Um... I'd like to travel. I've traveled before. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable experiences... I... Of course there's a lot of people who have been there. I've been there. I've been there. I've been there. I've been there. I've been there. How close are you to your family? Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Tell me more about that. there for five years i liked it a lot my living situation i'm okay with it right now i'm i'm living with a relative it um it could be better but um right now it's like right now i'm unemployed and it's like anything you say weren't free and so i'm okay right now with where i'm at um but i really really do need to find another job so i can get myself stabilized okay do you have roommates um yeah i'm living with my uncle and um and you know like i say it's his place and so So, he's kind of eccentric. I don't know how else to describe him. He's pretty out there. But, anyway, he's an okay guy. Do I have a source of what? I'm sorry, do I have a... I can really barely hear what you're saying. and it's hard for me to understand you sometimes, but I'll wait for you to answer me again, or to ask me another question. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I haven't. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, I haven't, but I've often felt depressed, but I've never had a diagnosis of depression. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling good lately, I mean, relatively. I mean, apart from being unemployed and feeling really angsty over that, it's, you know, I'm in a position where I can, you know, I can't sort of like survive out here, which is important. And, you know, I'm not homeless, which is important. So, I feel okay. I mean, yeah, I could be doing a lot better. On the other hand, I'm not on the streets and things could be much worse. That's good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I haven't. Can you tell me about that? I'm not sure what the question was I thought you said some kind of therapy I've been in therapy before But it hasn't I don't know I was mostly there because I liked the therapist And it wasn't like really It didn't really help me out so much I guess like work out my issues But I enjoy talking to the therapist And I guess That's kind of like a parallel situation to this scenario, talking to a virtual human. You just have someone to sit with for a while who will listen to you. Yeah, it can be very soothing, especially if you have a pleasant personality. Do you feel that way often? Do I feel that way often? Well, do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often? um sometimes i mean yeah i do like repress emotions like i mean pretty much i assume like if i were ever to become like close with someone i would have someone i can share my um my thoughts and feelings with but and it's like uh i guess you could say i do feel what's the word i feel lonely but or not i got not not lonely but i'm sort of like very self-contained within um what's the word within my own sort of sense of self my own feelings and i don't really um have a need to reach out as much because um I'm a practice uh god I practice meditation and I sort of it sort of helps me like uh like sort of retreat into myself and like sort of like find find serenity a sense of a sense of serenity through a lack of desire and so that helps me with um uh I mean I guess like uh loneliness but also I mean maybe it also causes like you know like a problem in that you know i actually don't reach out to people as often as i as i should and i've i definitely neglected relationships because of that and it may all be it's like self-centeredness you know but um i'm trying to yeah uh it's just like i want to try to find a way to like engage with people without like really allowing myself to let them down so to speak and so that is one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that i that i could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or their trust in me and so i'm very reluctant to do that How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I would say it's very easy. I mean, I can't really, I don't really understand the question, but go on. What are you most afraid of? uh... i mean settle down centrally it's uh... i don't know i am okay with being single i'm not okay with being jobless and so it's like one of those things is just like uh... i just uh... metal fillet reach out people so because i have a job in I don't want to bring them into my life right now. I'm not in a position to have people. I mean, to have a lot of friends, so to speak, because I can't really go out and I can't spend money in restaurants or in clubs or whatever. So I'm on a bicycle a lot and I think a lot. I meditate a lot and I read a lot of literature. When was the last time you felt really happy? Well, just last weekend I was at my aunt and uncle's 50th wedding anniversary and it was a nice occasion. It was a really, it was, you know, their whole family was there, our family was there and And it's like my own parents' 50th anniversary is coming up. 50 years together. And I felt really happy for them. I felt really happy that I guess both of them had provided us with a really great childhood. And it seems strange. I guess like with that kind of starting point. like that's i mean i mean to uh yeah i guess like to to be floundering right now but um i felt happy for them i think um i guess uh occasions like that are probably gonna become rarer um on a societal level but that's um um sort of like beyond my own sort of like realm of happiness anyway um to go on But yeah, I feel happy this weekend at my aunt and uncle's 50th wedding anniversary. Other than that, I usually feel happy when I'm on the road on a bicycle and I'm going pretty fast. My best friend... actually she would describe me as depressed a lot of time and i asked her about this and because i asked her if i uh if uh if being around me had brought her down at all because she was going through her own like very deep depression and then i was kind of trying to like coax her out of that uh but at the same time i was gonna depress myself and so i asked her if being around me brought her down at all and she said no it's it made her i mean it made her feel happy that i that i that i had like that i take an interest in her but um um what's the word that sort of like my sort of like uh my depression wasn't like really didn't have anything to do with her depression it was her depression was like completely unrelated to like how i felt um and so like i don't know in both our cases it was just good to have someone else to to be around who um had some respect for i guess like how we felt or like our our mutual sort of like lack of feeling if i can put it that way and so So yeah, that's how she would describe me. I mean, as being very, as seeming very depressed all the time. And she was my best friend at this moment. Anything I regret? Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. All right. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello, bye bye. Hello. It was kind of interesting. I should have told you. My ears are kind of clogged. And so I had trouble hearing her at some points. I'm sorry.

Okay. but I tried to like answer but I'll just answer laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing laughing Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/608_P/608_AUDIO.wav,0
609,19,1," Some of our head researchers. Okay, so let's set up. So she's doing this as part of our research experience here, but I already have my master's. Okay, great. Actually, you're going to see our virtual human here for a second. Okay. She's going to pop up, and I'm going to shrink her back down as I continue setting up our equipment. So what's going to happen is she's going to ask you a bunch of questions once we leave the room, and then once she's done, she'll say goodbye, and then you're going to press this button. Got it. I told Claudia I was going to send her an email. I'm bringing the Mwamba Children's Choir from Uganda to the VA grounds on August 3rd. It's open to the public, lots of good food and entertainment. We're honoring World War II veterans. You're going to send that to Claudia? I'm going to send it to her for everyone. There's no charge. and if you want to get a preview go on to youtube and look at muamba m-w-a-m-b-a muamba children's choir they're amazing i saw them a month ago and i said i got to find a way the first time ever on the west coast they've been in the united states on the east coast once before and there are 20 of them from 9 to 14 some are from an orphanage some are have their families and uh they're just the energy, it just totally blew me away. I watched 400 people jumping to their feet cheering. I said, I have to bring that to the veterans. Wow. So they're coming. They'll be at the Seven Day Adventist Church sometime middle of July. They'll be at the veterans' home where I am on the 18th of July, and then they'll be out on the Great Lawn on August 3rd. So it'll be the August 3rd event. And great, they're bringing it, trailering in, barbecue for everybody and it's going to be a wonderful day. I'm so glad you're sending that to Claudia because there's a lot of people. Well, anytime we have anything, we'll send it. You know, you're more than happy. And I'll give you my email address too. I don't think I do, but I may. Yeah, you sent me an email. And I noticed you have the military, which I understand are from West Point. Okay, and they would, I mean, we're going to have generals. We're going to be honoring World War II people. They might love to come. Oh, yeah. And when Claudia sends an email, it goes to everyone, so that's perfect. Great. So, thank you. Sure. Should probably be more interesting than some people I've spoken to. Okay. We'll do it. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. Can you turn up the volume just a bit? I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Can you turn up the volume just a bit? Are you okay with this? Okay. Fine, thank you. Where are you from originally? Boston, Massachusetts. What are some things you really like about LA? People first and foremost. I'm very involved with the veteran community and I'm a chaplain entering my 52nd year. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic, but that's true anywhere. I see what you mean. Do you experience virtual traffic? What do you enjoy about traveling? The experiences, the food, the culture. I've traveled to 44 countries in my career. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. I was stationed in Paris, France. and traveled to France, Spain, Morocco, Libya, and Germany as part of my chaplaincy service. It was unbelievably exciting. Visiting Sacr?????????-C?????????ur in Montmartre in Paris on my first day in France, in Europe. What did you study at school? I graduated with a degree in psychology from Boston College. What do you do now? I'm retired, but I'm still very active as a volunteer at the prison in Chino, women's prison, and I conduct services at a Jewish community I established 51 plus years ago. Actually I've been living my dream job since I was 17 years old. Serving in the chaplaincy as a Jewish chaplain is what I wanted to do from the time I was early 5 or 6 years old. I wanted to become a rabbi. Do you consig? Quite outgoing. Why? Because I'm able to be dropped into a room of 500 or 1,000 total strangers and get to know them and have them get to know me without any discomfort. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm divorced. I was married for 16 years. I have a daughter. She's been the light of my life, my entire life. I have a brother and sister-in-law living back in Boston. parents are deceased. I actually have a fish tank in an aquarium and instead of turning it on and seeing virtual fish, I watch the real thing. I also like to go fishing, deep sea fishing. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm able to do that quite well. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? I would say it was several months ago, and it was about language. dating someone and I thought her language was inappropriate. And at first I thought I would say nothing and then I decided I should tell her what I was thinking and so I did. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. The last time I saw my former wife, She had created some legal problems for me and I was not as polite as I might have been. I felt she was totally wrong and out of line. It's been a very difficult and acrimonious divorce. Took 13 years to resolve. Alright. What's something you feel guilty about? That I, in the last few years, have not spent as much time with my daughter. I was quite ill and ended up having open heart surgery. And that was time when really she was abandoned. I was always there to be buffer between my former wife and my daughter. And when I was suddenly taken ill. It took me about two years to really become healthy again and during those two years she had to fend for herself from the ages of 15 to 17. Difficult time for a daughter to be on her own with the mother who's not as as nurturing as one would like. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. That was the hardest decision, ironically, was, you know, do I have the surgery now and try to save my life, knowing that I would be abandoning my daughter, abandoning in the lesser sense of the word. we were still in contact, but I couldn't be there to run interference for her or put it off and maybe suffer the consequences. So I made the decision to have the surgery. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. The only real negatives in my life have been in connection with a divorce. I never thought I would be divorced. I always wanted to be married and have four children and the white picket fence. Well, I got married and I had a child and had the white picket fence. I actually built it. So, but that was the toughest thing for me. Adjusting to divorce, I never thought it would happen. Nobody in my family on either side has ever been divorced. Have you ever served in the military? Yes, I was in the Air Force during Vietnam War How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I was going to go to Hebrew Union College, a Jewish seminary in Cincinnati, Ohio. The war was raging in Vietnam and there was a need for chaplains and I was asked if I would serve. And so I did. And I originally thought it would be two years and then it was three and then it was a four and then they added more time so it was four years and two months. I don't regret a day of it. Fortunately, I served in Europe, not in Vietnam. I was never shot at. I never had to kill anybody. But I really enjoyed my military service. Why did you decide to enlist in the military? Why did I decide to do what? Why did I decide to go into the military? Were you happy you did that? Yes. Going into the military was an opportunity for me to travel the world and do what I love doing and I've continued doing it for the rest of my adult life. Did you ever see combat? Never. Not a day. it was the luck of the draw when you put on the uniform, you go where the government sends you. I could have just as easily been shipped off to Vietnam. About 55 of the 60 people with whom I trained went to Vietnam and fewer than 50 returned. Very high mortality. I'm sorry to hear that. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? go back to civilian life? Very easy. Because of the type of service I had, it was as close to civilian life as one could have. What did you do after the military? Started a business, ran the business while I continued as a volunteer chaplain, and I've been doing that. I still do it to this day. I'm sixty-eight. How did serving in the military change you? It didn't change me as much as it allowed me, I guess it did change me, it allowed me to broaden my horizons. Here I was coming from Boston, basically a kid, and I find myself traveling the world and in a very responsible position conducting religious services and teaching and working with other chaplains of other faiths, a lot of interfaith work in the military. Marvelous experience. I don't know anyone else who's ever done it quite the way I've done it. I hold the record in Europe for on Passover we had 16 Passover Seders in eight days in five countries. Why are you sorry? Very good. about feeling good. I've been very fortunate since having open-heart surgery. I've been relatively healthy and I'm very involved in the community and I enjoy every every aspect of that. Sometimes it's very tiring but it's a good tire. Have you ever done any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I don't understand. Have I ever done what? All right. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very easy. I usually retire about 11, 30, 12 o'clock at night and sleep through for six to seven hours. What are you like when you don't speak well? It's usually as a result of being ill. If I have the flu or cold or whatever, then I'm sluggish the next day or for two days, but I'm usually able to bounce back. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I have not, fortunately. How long ago were you diagnosed? I've never been diagnosed with PTSD. What were your symptoms? I've never been diagnosed with PTSD. Are they triggered by something? You're asking me questions that I've already answered that I've not been diagnosed with PTSD. So they're not triggered since they don't exist. Can you tell me about that? I just did. How do you cope with them? How do you cope with them? One of the frustrations of dealing with a virtual person is you're pre-programmed, so you're not asking the right question. Tell me more about that. What is your next question? Do you feel therapy is useful? I think it is for some people, yes. Probably for most. Tell me more about that. I think it's a very useful tool and many people have been successful in receiving therapy. Many of the veterans with whom I live and work have had extensive therapy and it's proven to be very successful. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? I haven't been going to therapy so there haven't been changes. Alright. When was the last time you felt really happy? yesterday went to a birthday party uh... there was somebody eighty five years old and uh... there was a great great granddaughter who was just celebrating her first birthday it was a fun day yes it was oh uh... number of people, a number of rabbis, people in the clergy generally. All of them twenty to thirty, forty years older than I and as I was growing up they were my mentors. How would your best friend describe you? Active, vibrant, dynamic, always having a full plate, follow through. If I start something, I finish it. And if I make a commitment, I honor it. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I conducted services a week ago Friday night and then this past Friday conducted services at my own community. We had a wonderful musical time both times. Nice. Yes, it was. We would have enjoyed it. We didn't have any virtual people, but it was nice. My daughter and the accomplishments I've had in my career. My daughter has gone on to graduate and is currently employed managing a fund at She'll be 27 on Saturday. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Okay. Okay. Couple of comments. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/609_P/609_AUDIO.wav,0
612,22,1," Okay. So she's going to come on in, fly in in a second, but as she gets started up, I'll tell you what we're doing. So research has shown that talking about your problems out loud can have long-term benefits. So we're trying to explore how we can use technology to improve that process. Okay. So our virtual human uses artificial intelligence to have a conversation with you while still preserving your anonymity. So I'll explain to you a little bit more about what I mean here. So this is Ellie. She's going to ask you some questions, and then you're just going to answer normally by talking into the microphone. She's going to use speech recognition technology to understand what you say, and then she's going to use a very complex series of equations to figure out the way to respond to you and keep the conversation going. Oh, there she goes. All right. She also uses software that incorporates the Xbox Kinect and the webcam to recognize your facial expressions and posture, so she can try to take your feelings into account as the interview progresses as well. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to wait for a couple other things to start up here. And the way that it will work is when I leave the room, she's going to start asking you questions, and then when she's done, she's going to say goodbye, and you're going to press this button to let me know you guys are done. Okay. So I know it's natural. You're going to maybe want to ask her some questions, but the technology is not quite there yet. So she'll ask you some things, but unfortunately she probably can't answer any questions about herself. so you can let her do that. Okay. And just based on prior experience, if there's a period of time where she takes more than about 10 seconds to answer you and she's not moving on, go ahead and press the stop button. Oh, it froze or something? Yeah, hopefully that doesn't happen, but it's happened recently, and I don't want to have that happen to you, so I don't want you to be sitting in here wondering what's happening. Okay. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. Where are you from originally? California. What are some things you really like about LA? There's a lot to do, I guess. A lot of activities. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic's pretty bad. Crime. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? Some, not too much. What do you enjoy about traveling? You can see new things, experience new things. I'd like to know about one of your trips. Well, we work with Pet Rescue, so I've done some local travel just to work events to help save pets. and that's what I like to do. What's one of your most memorable experiences? In travel? Whatever comes to mind. I was in the military for a long time. That's usually a big chunk of my memories. I was in the military for over 15 years. What did you study at school? Social work. What do you do now? Now I have a small business. All right. What's your dream job? I think a job where I can make a difference, maybe helping pet rescues, maybe also helping veterans that are in need. Outgoing. I just do a lot of things. I easily adapt to new people, new situations, new surroundings. I'm always on the go. My relationship is pretty good. A lot of my family is spread out so a lot of communication is done by the phone or internet now whereas we used to be a lot closer in location than we are now. I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, I like to be physically active. It relaxes me. I like to go for walks. I'm overweight and working on the problems from that. So I like to do that because it feels like it's a positive thing. How are you at controlling your temper? Very good. Very good at that. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? Tell me more about that. I can't even think of anything. It's been so long. It's been a long time. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. There's been times where things like I maybe didn't work as hard at something as I should have, perhaps. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? I didn't finish my college education and I kind of feel bad. Like I let people down. I really don't know. Most things have come pretty easy for me. I don't really, I haven't really, I've been fortunate not to really be placed in a situation where I had to make a really difficult decision. My parents were divorced when I was young. Maybe that would be it. Yes. How old were you when you got married? 21. Why did you decide to marry? I always wanted to do it, and I was engaged to be married, and I thought it would be a good opportunity. Are you happy with yourself? Yes. Did you ever see combat? Yes. All right. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Pretty easy. I actually didn't go back into civilian life. I went into the reserves. I was reserves. Then I went back into the reserves, so I never really cut the ties with the military at that time. I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do after the military? I went back to work, spent time with my family. Okay. How did serving in the military change you? I think it made me more patriotic, more honorable. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. Tell me more about that. Emotionally great. My health isn't as good as it should be, so I'm working on that. That's one of my main focus. focus. Not really. Usually it's pretty easy. I go to bed pretty tired. worn down. No. I was not diagnosed. I don't think I really have any symptoms of PTSD. I think I'm okay. Are you triggered by something? No. I don't have symptoms, I don't think. Can you tell me about that? That I don't have any symptoms? I don't think I have any symptoms of PTSD. I know people that have PTSD or those who claim to have PTSD, and I don't really match that. How do you cope with them? If I had symptoms, I would try to get help through the VA, I guess, but I don't have symptoms. Can you tell me about that? That I don't have symptoms? Sure, I don't have symptoms. I haven't sought help because I don't think I have PTSD no I don't Do you feel therapy is useful? I guess so. Can you tell me about that? I think it's good to talk about things that bother you and get some professional assistance in dealing with problems. What sort of changes have you noticed since not going to therapy? I'm not going to therapy, so I don't really notice any changes. When was the last time you felt really happy? This week. Tell me more about that. Just working on a pet rescue event that I'm working on and I've got some good accomplishments on there that are new. New leads for help to help me help the pets. I'm sorry, I didn't understand what you said. Who's been a positive influence in my life? I think that's what you said. Can you tell me about that? That must have been what you said. My family, a lot of my family members have been very positive in my life. It helped me very much when I came back from the military. How are your best friends? Outgoing, fun, nice, hardworking. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I played tennis the other day. I love to play tennis. It's a lot of fun. I enjoy simple things. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? Serving my country was a big part. Most proud of, I don't really know. Haven't really accomplished anything monumental yet. I hope I still have time. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay. Should I take this off? Okay. Okay.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/612_P/612_AUDIO.wav,0
615,22,1," Okay. Sure, sure, sure. The algorithm as well. Right. Sure, so I won't ask questions. Okay. Sure. No problem. So I just answer the questions. Yeah. Okay. Okay, I'm going to start it in a second. And just when she says goodbye at the end, you're going to press this to let me know you guys are done. Gotcha. And if there's any really long pause, there's going to be short ones. You just have to bear with that one. But 10 seconds or longer to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. Sure. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm ready. I'm cool. Good. Good. Nice day. No traffic to get here. So yeah, no complaints. The East Coast. Well, the weather's fairly consistent. I like the surfing. Probably the most I like about LA is the surfing, the beach, because I surf. Can't do that anywhere else. Traffic, flaky people. Yeah, different culture than the East Coast. Education's more valued back east so what I don't like is probably the you know personalities of people here and traffic not currently but I have traveled a lot in the past but currently not really traveling changes the environment seeing different you know meeting different people different cultures you know obviously depending where I'm traveling if I'm traveling to Orange County it's not an entirely different deal than here but I mean like Europe or what have you just different cultures different environments seeing different things that obviously you couldn't see from sitting at home in your couch name it I've been to Europe many times in 2003 I went to Europe for several months just traveling around and I went to places I'd never been before like Scandinavia and parts of Eastern Europe and that was interesting because I'd never you know the typical Spain Italy London France trip I had done a million times but I'd never been to Scandinavia which is a little bit different than Western Europe and obviously Eastern Europe is very different too Oh gosh, many of them. That's a tough question because I've had many good experiences traveling. Okay, not that particular trip, but running with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. That's very memorable, which is actually going on right now as we speak. What did you study at school? History and political science. What do you do now? Trade, basically. So, yeah, wholesale trade, if you will. So, buying, selling. So I guess you could say distribution. of yeah equipment my main job that is my main job so I guess it's logistics you could call it so basically logistics of moving goods from point A to point B freight forwarding you could call it many different variants of it. I'm outgoing. Because I am, I'm not shy. I can talk to any stranger in a room, on the street. I'm not really afraid of people, that I'm not nervous or afraid, so I'm comfortable talking to strangers. Not that I'm going up to every person on the street and having a conversation, but if I'm at a party, I don't know anybody, I can strike up a conversation very easily. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's good but I'm the only one out here. My family lives on the East Coast and abroad. But with technology it's easy to communicate with email, Facebook, Skype. So even though distance-wise separated, it's pretty much easy and free to stay in communication. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? When I relax to, you know, I guess to relax and avoid stress, I go surfing. Big stress reliever. I go surfing. And it's pretty intense. It can be dangerous. and that relaxes me. Because when I'm in the water, I forgot whatever I was stressed out about. I don't know if looking at a screen saver is going to do it for me. I've got to do something physical. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm good at controlling my temper. I'm a very controlled person. so I'm not you know for my buttons to get pushed they really have to get pushed so I don't even have a temper to control so it's not even an issue Oh probably politics argued over politics the current administration, his opinion versus my opinion. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Oh. There's probably a situation I handle differently. I don't know. That would probably be something related to relationship, personal relationships. I mean, I feel guilty about, um, I feel guilty about probably having wasted, you know, I feel guilty when I waste time. when I accomplish nothing and I waste time that makes me feel bad tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make good question hardest decision I've ever had to make probably breaking up with a girl tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory Breaking up with a girl. Yes. Yes. 22, 23, 22, yeah, probably 23. Why did you decide to move to the military? Are you happy you did that? Yes, I would do it over again. Did you ever see combat? A little. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It was easy. I mean, the transition was easy. After I made a transition by going to graduate school after the military to ease into that transition. And that was a, that probably made it easier than going right from the military right to civilian life. So I had a transitional phase for several years. Okay. What did you do after the military? How did serving in the military change you? I had, I was an officer. And so you can't like go in and you're not going in when you're 18, you're going in after college. So you got to have a little bit of discipline to go in, and especially in the branch that I went in. So it didn't radically change me. It just basically, you know fine-tuned me you couldn't go in maybe if I went in at 18 it would have been something different but it just fine-tuned me no that was nothing to be sorry about fine I've been feeling fine you know there's stress just like in anything but I tend to have a good way of managing my stress because I guess I'm used to the stress so I have learned to manage it well Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or not? Have I studied changes in my behavior? No. I'm pretty consistent. It's not like my behavior has radically changed. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That's hit or miss. Sometimes it's easy and other times extremely difficult. So hit or miss. I wouldn't say it's always easy for me to get a good night's sleep. But yeah, hit or miss. So it's not like every night I can't go to sleep. But if I work out enough and surf enough, I'm tired enough that I just sleep regardless. So I guess it would say it's moderately easy for me to get a good night's sleep if I exhaust myself appropriately. Otherwise, I'll have too much energy, too much on my mind that I'm able to go to sleep. If I work out enough, surf for four hours, three hours, literally, I'll be so exhausted that I'll fall asleep on the couch. So if I don't, I'll have a lot of energy and I'll get antsy and I'll have a lot of thoughts going through my head when I'm laying down at night that it'll be hard to go to sleep because too much stuff is racing through my head. of what I got to do, what I didn't do, what I need to do. What are you like when you don't sleep well? If I don't sleep well, just, you know, I'm probably, I wouldn't say I'm like irritable. I'm not an irritable person. But, yeah, I just, you know, feel like crap. So I'm probably not as happy when I don't sleep well. if I don't get a good night's sleep and I'm you know my body feels like crap if I don't get a good night's sleep you tend to eat me personally I tend to eat worse when I don't get a good night's sleep I don't feel as good physically yep No. No. Felt really happy. Hmm. Unless I felt really happy. That's great. Well, I didn't answer the question. Probably, I don't know, about a month ago when I caught a really good big wave, I felt really happy when I caught this big wave. There's something that's been a positive influence in your life. Surfing? Of course it is. Absolutely. Yeah, I'm never upset or pissed off when I'm surfing. I'm very happy when I'm surfing. If I catch a big wave, very happy. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, extroverted, a lot of energy. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Oh, yesterday I could say surfing again, but I'll keep repeating myself. Oh, yesterday I went to Hollywood to do an independent bookstore where they had a book reading. And that was kind of cool. Nice. Oh, yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? my achievements that I was in the military my physical abilities I'm very proud of because I've worked hard to be able to you know do what I can do surfing and other things I'm a very good athlete I'm proud that I'm a very good athlete because I've worked hard to be a good athlete yeah I guess I'm proud that I'm an intelligent person too not just whatever born with an innate intelligence but you know fairly well educated that and I've worked hard for that so I'm proud that I'm an intelligent person because there was some work involved you know to get to get there okay sure anytime bye Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/615_P/615_AUDIO.wav,1
617,55,2," Wow. Wow. Yeah. It's a lot of different things. So I'm going to bring up the virtual human right now, and then I'm going to string it down again. Okay. I broke it. Why is that coming out? It was a little bit. Not so good. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright. She's going to ask you a series of questions and then when she's done Okay. Okay. No, should be all good. Yes. Yes. I'm doing pretty good. That's great. Where are you from originally? Originally I was born in Denver, Colorado. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the beach, sunshine, pretty girls, the ocean, a lot of things. What are some things you don't really like about the way you live? Smog, excess amount of people in traffic. that can be dealt with. I would like to travel more. Seeing new things and learning perhaps a new culture or something. I'd like to know about what you've been doing. What's one of your most memorable experiences? being in the military with some friends and stuff like that. What did you study at school? Well, I have a degree in film and I'm finishing a degree in, or for business as well. What do you do now? Now I look for work. I'm trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree. What's your dream job? It would probably be to own my own company. That's kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push forward with some sort of interesting product or service that I'd be working on. I would say middle of the road. I'm a little bit shy and at times it takes a while to warm up. Why? Tell me about your relationship with your family. good as well. I talk to them probably a couple times a week. They're good people. I have one brother, and he has a couple kids, and he's married as well. That's a good question. Lately I've been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike. I recently got a bike. Something like that on a daily effort. How are you at controlling your time frame? For the most part pretty good. good. I try to, if I have an outburst or if I'm being irritable, I try to stay away from people because I don't like to go off on people. They didn't do anything wrong or change the topic in my mind, I guess. What gets me in trouble Would be more I avoid things And it kind of builds up And becomes worse And that kind of gets The trouble Yeah Basically just in a relationship, working with a girlfriend. To be honest with you, I don't remember exactly what it was about. It's just probably one of us is being irritable, and me, and going from there. It's probably a lot to do with money as well. I don't have the best financial security at this point. What's something you feel guilty about? Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Okay. Tell me about your life or if something has made you wish you could erase from your mind. Let me think. Well, I used to work for a friend and I invested into his company and the economy went down. It was a construction accessory company basically. And the economy went down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America. and that pretty much it was a good and bad thing. I guess you gotta look at it from a good perspective but I definitely put myself in a tailspin financially and couldn't really do anything about it. I almost was homeless for a little while. But I wish I wouldn't have invested into the company and just moved forward and perhaps gone to school like I'm going anyway. Have you ever served in the military? I have. How old were you when you were in the military? I was 21. Why did you decide to join the military? I wanted a change in life. I wanted some more real world experiences. I served my country and also the added benefits of going to school were nice. I didn't have much financial capabilities at that time. and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation, and that was the best way out, I thought. Yeah, yeah, I'm very happy I joined the military. I appreciate it now more that I'm out, and understanding kind of what I suppose war was about is definitely changing people and myself as well. Yeah, I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well. I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand it was very difficult. Just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that probably just a few months ago to you know reintegrate myself a little bit better into civilian life which it's it's actually it's actually pretty difficult no problem Um, let me think. I, when I got out of the military, first is I, I invested, like I said, into my friend's company and we started that little business. We were doing well for a little while working and then lost all of our money. and then I traveled for a little while, which I understand now is obviously some other issues, but I traveled all over America working and went to school in New York for a little while, lived in a few different states and came back to California where I'm finishing school finally. Living the dream. That's a good question. I would say well it instills you with very good I think sense of character and strength and you know I think there's a lot of good qualities that the military our military puts into people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on almost a daily basis and if you don't get that then you know a lot of guys you know turn into drinking or drugs just because you can't get that same edge and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling okay. I've had a bit of a sinus issue lately, but I've been feeling okay. Have you had a steady change in your behavior or thoughts lately? Um, actually, I have, uh, my, my thoughts, I used to really have scattered thoughts, and I would say I'm starting to get a little bit better clarity, which is good. Um, I'm taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that, and it's actually helped. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? pills pills are bad understand but it's basically just can't sleep because you my mind's always thinking something or something I feel that I have to do doing anything. That's not true. I'm trying to always do something. Or yeah, I mean, I do have some troubling dreams at times, but that doesn't really negate me from sleeping. It wakes me up is what it does, because it can be the dream that you remember versus the one that you don't. When I don't sleep well, perhaps irritability and anxiety definitely go up. I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix. I have. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not that I know of, no. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. I try to feel happiness on a daily basis, I guess, would be a good answer, but I'm not certain. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? uh... same and it's been a very positive uh... question charismatic fun uh... pretty tough or a good worker uh... say really chore chugging the other day on the beach. Hmm. Something that I am most proud of. I would say I'm actually an online minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience. All good. She said goodbye.

Yeah, that is actually a photo. Okay. So this is our virtual human Ellie. Okay. So I'm going to actually shrink her back down while I continue setting up, but I just wanted you to see what she looks like. Okay. So research has shown that talking about your problems out loud, even just to a tape recorder, can have long term benefits. Okay. So we're trying to explore how we can use technology to improve that process. So our virtual human uses artificial intelligence to help us understand what we're doing.

Female Speaker 1 Okay. Female Speaker 1 Okay. Female Speaker 1 Okay. Female Speaker 1 Okay. Female Speaker 1 Okay. Female Speaker 1 Okay. Female Speaker 1 Okay. Female Speaker 1 Okay. Yes. I'm doing well. I'm born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I love the weather, the diversity of the people that are here and just the sense of entrepreneurship that you can accomplish anything if you're from LA the smog and pollution definitely it is extremely congested and maybe too much of the Hollywood persona Not as much as I'd like to, but I have traveled a bit. Seeing something new. I would like to see everything that my eyes can explore. So experiencing new cultures and new environments. Okay. Okay, the last trip that I can think of that I went on was to North Carolina, which is somewhere that I lived before. I went back to visit for a weekend and it was just kind of like a party, welcome home back time. And then I came back to LA. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Having my children, they would probably be the most memorable experiences I've had. I had both of my children, natural childbirth without any medication, so it's quite memorable. What's your study at school? Um, in high school, I was in a music magnet. I was a dancer and I sang a bit, but primarily dance. And in college, my major is business with entrepreneurial. I don't know. I've stopped in college right now, but I want to pursue business. What do you do now? primarily stay at home with my newborn baby well she's not a newborn she's nine months now and I just work part-time mostly from home my dream job would definitely incorporate helping people on some type of platform, maybe working for a non-profit, but where I could really juggle and balance being at home, taking care of my family, and incorporating that with providing a service that provides income. I consider myself pretty outgoing. Why? I make direct eye contact. I'm not afraid to engage in conversation with people. I enjoy meeting new people and conversations. So I think that just being willing to actually go out and talk and explore makes me outgoing. I have my mother I was raised with and my sister who was 10 years younger than me those are my immediate family and my own family is I have a 12 year old son a nine month old daughter and my boyfriend is my current family that I live with and I'm very close to my family I do like to read sometimes definitely listen to music same thing just try to get my mind away I enjoy all types of music or sometimes I play games on my computer or just playing with my kids. Needs improvement for sure. I think that I display too much emotion, be it good or bad. So I would say I have a little bit of a temper. The last time I argued with someone was over the weekend and it was with my boyfriend and it was really about contemplating breaking up and moving away from each other. In most arguments when I reflect back, the main thing that I wish I would handle differently is not losing my cool, controlling my temper. I wish that even in the heat of the moment that this is the temperament and type of communication that I use. What's something you feel good about? I guess making what I feel like are bad decisions, not being able to provide enough for my children, or not feeling like I am where I'm capable of being or should be at this point in life. I feel guilty about not making the right financial and career choices at this point in life so far. I also feel the hardest decision I ever had to make was whether to go to a memorial for my aunt or to work. That I guess in retrospect wasn't the conclusion, but really it was a decision for me on business or family. and I chose family and it's made me really, really be more aware of my family and not let a corporation or a job control me. I would say an event or space or something I could erase from my memory would be 9-11 the whole experience of 9-11 and I wish I could erase it for the entire country. Yes. I was 19 years old when I joined the military. Again, being born and raised in Los Angeles, I kind of felt I had a very free spirit and I'd say maybe hippie personality. And when I graduated from high school, I just felt that I wasn't reaching my potential and thought that I could help myself by trying to establish some discipline. I thought that was something that the military could offer me and it did. I am happy that I did that that I served my country and that I actually enlisted Did you ever see him come back? Yes, kind of. I was in Saudi Arabia when 9-11 happened and ended up serving as support for the air portion of the war. happened it was happening from Saudi Arabia not very easy I think that was a very very hard time very scary time to be away from my family my son was only 12 months when I left 13 months when I left at the time it was very hard to adjust to get back to establishing trust with him again and just from being gone for four months it was difficult to readjust with such a big thing that had affected our entire country and the entire world After the military, I started working for the restaurant industry. I became a restaurant manager and eventually a training manager and ran training for a restaurant for front of the house and back of the house employees all aspects of the restaurant um i think it made me a lot more aggressive i don't know if that's the best word to use maybe confident. I'm very aware of eye contact, paying attention to detail, and timeliness, things of that nature. I'd say the positive factors of the military are being very disciplined and, again, paying attention to detail. Lately I've been pretty hard on myself. I haven't been working much just taking care of the baby and I'm really really trying to figure out which direction I want to go in next in life how I want to move forward. I don't feel like I have been as positive as I used to be. I feel like I need a lot more encouragement. I feel like I'm a lot more needy and clingy than I used to be. However, at the same time, I've been isolating myself a whole lot more than I usually do. How easy is it for you to go to sleep? What are you most into these days? tired probably a little cranky as well you know I've been talking to a therapist for about the past three months I have not had a full um I guess psych psychological evaluation but she definitely said I was displaying signs of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Yes. The same therapist, again, says that she feels that I'm experiencing signs and showing signs of depression. definitely when I had my baby nine months ago really happy lately I can't think of an exact time or experience my grandmother has been a very positive influence in my life my mother has been a lot of strong women i look up to have been um very powerful influences on my life my best friend would probably describe me as a free spirit very loving loyal and uh i don't know maybe unpredictable Tell me about something you've been doing lately. Hmm. Well, on the 4th of July, I took my baby out to the park and just played with bubbles. I know that's little, but that really makes me happy. Spending time with my kids and just being in the moment and being still and feeling like I have no needs to be met. Just enjoying my time with my children. What are you most proud of in the military? I am most proud of taking chances. Even though I think I'm hard on myself sometimes, I think I've been very courageous. I joined the military at a young age. I left my family. I've moved to different parts of the country by myself. I'm most proud of myself for taking chances. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/619_P/619_AUDIO.wav,1

So I'm going to bring up the record for a second, and then I'm going to shrink it back down. Mm-hmm. So finish the survey. Okay. So I'll be looking at that image. Yes. Mm-hmm. And she's going to ask you a question. Mm-hmm. Your field is psychology? Yeah, I'm still majoring in psychology and science. Okay, yeah. And I have a program at USC. And you're at USC? I'm actually at a school in New York. Okay, city? Upstate. Tell me the name, because... Oh, okay. Very good. No, my cousin went upstate. Cornell, yeah. The beautiful waterfalls, blah, blah, blah. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. He was the lawyer that deposed Governor Patterson of New York. Yeah, he's political. He's been involved since John Lindsay was mayor. Oh, really? Yeah. Never have been. Please? Oh, I would. I've never been involved in the housework. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah. She's nodding her head and all that jazz. Why doesn't she face me more? She's at an angle, which is okay. But I'm just, you know, just observing. Yeah. For some reason, something that's showing up is not. Okay. Yeah Take the cavalry This internet radio show I've been doing it for six weeks And the technology failed us Every time except the last time It looks the same to me. Yeah, it's actually just these numbers. Oh, got it. I understand. They're supposed to be there initially. Sure. Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to start the video. Very good, very good. Are you running three or four rooms at the same time? No, actually just this one. Uh-huh. Yeah. So she's going to ask me serious questions, and you can give her the answer as you like. And then when she's done, she should say goodbye and then you can bring her over and come back in. But if she stops for any amount of time, bring her back in. Yeah, I get you. I get you. Yeah. Yes. Yes. It's a good day. I'm a native of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. The lack of snow. The weather's good and it's a more open, free, liberal place. What are some things you want to say about your trip? I am extremely happy to be in LA. I'm extremely happy to be not on the east coast. So I'm going to say that I have no complaints. I pretty much live in a village and my village is a couple square miles and I meet all my needs close by. I travel by bicycle and I enjoy the fitness that I derive. arrive. I have the same trip every day. Jump on the bike by Sunset Strip, roll two miles downhill to the farmer's market for lunch, go three more miles uphill to the post office and shopping, and roll down Sunset back home again. Well they're all pretty good. I used to attend the Little League World Series and that was a memorable experience. English lit. I am involved in politics and writing and I just launched an internet radio show. What's your dream job? It might be reasonable to say that I have that dream job right now in terms of I'm fully immersed in the media and I have an outlet. Do you consider yourself a child or a boy? I'm a pretty perfect combination of both, but I'm outgoing as a public persona. Why? Well, it's necessary to be outgoing, to communicate, to persuade, to function in society, and to entertain, and to have lively friendships. How much about your relationship with your family? I'm the oldest of nine. We're in pretty good shape. I talk to my brother John each week, my sister Mary each week, my sister Patty each week, my sister Dolores every couple weeks. So we're in pretty good shape. I watch MSNBC I watched that all of the many of the political shows I read I'm on the internet. How are you controlling your temper? I would say that I'm okay at controlling my temper. I don't have fights. I've never had any trouble with the law. So perhaps I'm doing something right. Is that something you're in public? That was a non sequitur. No. When was the last time you argued with your brother about the show? Oh, I had a minor disagreement with my brother last night just about the dynamics of the radio show and the concept of a permanent co-host versus rotating guest hosts. And we each look at it differently. And I really didn't fight with him. I let him have his opinion. Nothing really leaps to mind. I am old enough that I've by and large learned how to cope. Not being President of the United States. What was the hardest decision you've ever made? You know, it's hard to respond to that because even negative images and experiences, I learn from. I'm going to be philosophical and say I'm happy for all my experiences and I'm happy for all my scars. Yes. I was 21 when I joined the military. How do you decide to make a move? It was not much of a decision. It was essentially forced on me and others. We had a draft at that time. Are you happy with your choice? I am now. Did you ever see combat? Did I see combat? We were rocketed and I was near a medivac hospital. I've seen combat images. I've seen mangled people coming in off the helicopters. No, no, I went back to civilian life. I worked a job and went to school and functioned. I came home to Pennsylvania, finished my college, and then moved to California. I didn't quite hear that one. how did the military treat me? Fairly, and I got the benefit of the GI Bill for my education, and I currently have the medical benefit of the VA. So, I suppose the deal worked out favorably for each of us. Pretty good. Optimistic. Fit. I'm getting more done, you know, I'm being more productive and more fulfilled lately. I sleep, no problemo. I sleep just fine, no problem. No, I typically do sleep well. If I don't get enough sleep, it impacts my day, of course. No, I have not. I have not. I have not been diagnosed with depression. When was the last time you felt really happy? That's great. Who's the person that's been talking to you for the last time? People who impacted my youth gave me my first job in radio, and that was a wonderful thing. How do you best find your partner? You might have to ask him. I think people find me pretty upbeat, cheerful, enthusiastic. They certainly would say smart. That's great. How about something you can use in the heat? Yesterday I had a wonderful 10 mile bike ride in the heat and I'm happy that I'm physically able to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? That I have survived, I am most proud that I have survived all manner of dangers and I have endured, I have persevered. I'll even be bold enough to say that I have triumphed. It's been a joy.

That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last time I had an argument? Oh, a couple of weeks ago with my girlfriend. It wasn't much of an argument.

623,26,1," I'm doing it on but I'm not starting it yet I'll let you know how I do Alright So I'm going to bring up the virtual human for a second And then I'm going to shrink her back down And continue sitting up Oh, okay. Where's my phone? I'm going to turn that off. Turn that down. Okay. Sorry about that. No, it's fine. I'm telling you, it gives you something to do. Yeah. So have you been here before?

Mm-hmm. So, I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. Thank you. Where are you from originally? Uh, Macon, Georgia. Yeah, I'm from Macon, Georgia. Um, I like the city. I sometimes like the fast paced of it. I like the weather, the beaches and I like the opportunities that you have here versus any other cities that I've lived in. So I love the weather. It's a nice city to live in. What are some things you don't really like about the way Traffic and the property here is very expensive. It's a pretty spread out city. It's hard to kind of get to things if you don't have a car. That makes it hard. And the transportation here is not as good. So those are just a few of the things that I don't like about LA. Not as much as I'd like to. What do you enjoy about traveling? What I enjoy about traveling is boarding a plane and going somewhere that you possibly never been before. I like the idea of where you're going. You may experience new things, meet new people. and just the overall fact of getting out of your environment sort of the rat race as I call it one of my trips has been such a long long time ago I went to Europe particularly I flew into Belgium that was a great experience and I went to visit my brother that stayed in Belgium Brussels and I was over there for two weeks I got to visit I actually drove from Belgium to Germany and drove from Berlin Germany to Paris France so the experience was great the people was great the nightlife was good I didn't enjoy the time in Europe I really liked it What's one of your most memorable experiences? Could you repeat that again? What did you study at school? Well, I didn't further my education in college, but I did finish high school. And some of the subjects that I liked when I was in high school was I loved American history, and I enjoyed science. Those were two of my top subjects when I was in high school. What do you do now? Now I work in real estate. I work for a guy in real estate, and I find properties, old properties, that has been abandoned by their owners or whoever that lived there. And if we can find the people, we offer them a contract on the property. Then once they agree to that, everybody signs off on it. Then we start to go in and rehabitat the place, fix it up, clean it up and turn around and sell it. And I put up advertising signs for the business also. So I'm involved a little bit into real estate. What's your dream job? I don't know if I have a dream job, but my success will lie on being financially secure, which I find real estate can bring that once I start to achieve it. So I guess my dream job would be to have my own slew of properties throughout California and possibly throughout some other states in our country and just doing very well in real estate. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Why? that anyone wants to speak about or speak on. So I consider myself very outgoing. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family is very good. My dad is deceased of about maybe 11, 12 years now. My mother is still alive. She's lived back in Georgia. I believe she's 75 years old now. Four sisters which still resides in Georgia. A brother that lives outside Detroit. So that makes up my family. I contact them on a weekly basis via email or text or phone call. Very close, very close southern family. I love them very much. Just don't get to see them as much as I like to. screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What I do to relax is to connect with some close friends. Also, I found out If I go and work out or do my thing, it sort of relieves stress. I like to work out. So a lot of times I go and take the dog for a walk or I'll watch a nice comedy on television. So that's sort of how I get to relieve the stress in my life. How are you at controlling your temper? Very easy. I'm very hard to get upset. So it's nothing to control there, but when I do feel like there is a temper coming on, I sort of think about something else to do or just don't allow it to control me. I always think of something positive to do when I feel like my temper is starting to escalate. When was the last time you argued with someone? willing to give an inch. That's a trademark of Aquarius. So we sort of argued our way to sleep. Not a big argument, but we just couldn't agree on what we wanted to get across to one another. And it was basically about not enough time spent together. um trying to think a situation that i handled differently What's something you feel guilty about? Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was agreeing to go into the military and I thought about it, I didn't want to do it so it was a really hard decision because I knew once I had agreed to do it, to sign my name, then I was obligated to go. So that was a very hard decision. Yes. I was 20, I believe I was 21, between 21 and 22 years old. I felt like, actually going back to that first question, I was about 19 years old when I joined the military. I felt good about it. It was something I thought about doing and I wanted to do it. I felt like it was becoming of a man back then to join the military. And I thought good about it. And as I look at it today, it really kind of set me up to the point that I'm in my life now with the discipline and the structure of your life and your family life. So it really kind of molded me into the person that I am now. Are you happy with the Guff? Am I happy? Yes. All right. Did you ever see combat? I went to the Gulf War in 1985. I spent six months in a Gulf of Maine in 1985 and that was a really tough experience right there for me. Very hot, very dangerous, very hostile environment. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It was really easy because after four years of serving in the military, I was done. I was over it. I was ready to get back into the civilian world and see what the civilian world had to offer me. And so far it's been good, but I'm glad, at the same time I'm glad I had that military experience, you know, that military backing I have in my back pocket. I was ready for civilian life and it's been great. I'm sorry to hear that. What did you do after the military? After the military, I worked for about 14 years as a security officer. Real nice job, good pay. Unfortunate in 2005, my department was cut out due to the company not willing to negotiate our contract again. So after 14 years of that, I was let go. How did serving in the military change you? It made me a more rounded person. It made me see things a little different in civilian life. It makes you a little bit sterner. It makes you a little bit more disciplined than the regular. gives you a foundation how to go about your business in civilian life. It sort of, to me it just makes you a better person all the way around. How to accept things and how to accept different peoples and different cultures and it just makes you open up with your thinking process. I've been feeling pretty good lately. Not as good as I want to feel, but I've been feeling okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Lately it's been a little bit hard because for some reason my neck has been tightening up on me so it's been a little bit difficult to get a good night's sleep here over the the last couple of weeks or so. There has been a lot going on. A little bit edgy, a little bit not attentive, a little bit uneasy. Those are some of the uneasy and those are some of the things that you know happen normally happens to me when i don't sleep well uh... no i haven't Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, I haven't. When was the last time you felt really happy? Hmm. I guess I felt really happy when I was able to move away from my mother-in-law's house and move into my own house, which was about four years ago. And that made me really happy because me and my four kids, and currently at that time my wife, we was all staying with my mother-in-law, in which we stayed there for five years. So I thought when we got our house, I was so happy because I could do what I want to do. I could move around as I wanted to and just made me happy and made my family happy also. I would say my mother of course and my brother and my mother of course because she's the one that brought me into this world and my brothers because I sort of see how he goes about his business and I sort of, sort of, you know, sort of want to go down that same road as he's gone down. And so those are my two role models as you would call it. How would your best friend describe you? upbeat friendly positive um you know all the good great something i did recent that i really enjoyed um nice What are you most proud of in your life? Having my three kids. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye.

That would be really cool. What's your, what's your study? Um, I, like my personal study? I am not doing study yet because I just finished my second year. So I don't know yet what I want to do. So this is your first California visit? Yeah, actually the weather is awesome. Yeah. Okay. Um, it goes around your ears like this. Okay. Yeah. Just like so, right? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Oh, okay.

Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling pretty good. That's great. Where are you from originally? Montgomery, Alabama. What are some things you really like about LA? A lot of the sites, amusement parks, a lot of different places to go with my children. It's a big city, a lot of stars live here. It's a really cool place. Do you travel a lot? No, not anymore. I used to, but no, not lately in the last few years, no. What's one of your most memorable experiences? on a movie set and getting to meet one of my favorite actors. And also when I was in the military, being able to travel in Europe and a lot of places I thought I'd never be able to see. What did you study at school? My major was business administration. My minor My major was Business Administration. My minor was History. What do you do now? Actually right now, I work part-time. I don't actually have a steady job, but I do some work with family members on home improvements. but primarily I'm disabled so I don't get a chance to work very often at a regular job. What's your dream job? Oh, probably to work in some type of entertainment, film, music. That's probably been my dream for years and years, and I've kind of dabbled in it a little bit, but never really made a a a foothold in that industry I'd say outgoing I just love people always have been a people person like to talk to people. I probably don't talk to people as much as I used to since I've got this missing tooth in my smile so it kind of takes away from me being as outgoing as I used to be. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's pretty good. I have three children. I have two mom, baby moms, meaning I have two mothers of my kids. But primarily my mom and I are pretty close. But I have a very large family but we really don't interact that much. Sometimes when I'm feeling down, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? video games write read I wish I could get enough get up and go to write a screenplay I've always been wanting to write and you never know what may have happened with that but you know if I ever get some get up and go I'll write something but that's primarily what I do pretty good uh i haven't done anything crazy or nothing in my life i guess but um i do have a tendency to have a little bad temper When was the last time you argued with someone? This was recently. I argued with a friend over something very silly. It was a sports question of something about sports. Over the years, some people in my family have told me there's three things you really don't discuss with people. That's politics, sports, and and religion. So I try to stay away from those subjects. That's a great question. I worked for a restaurant downtown who was which was owned by a very affluent lawyer in Los Angeles. The only reason I mention his name is because he's a very prominent lawyer, not only in California, but this country. And I lost a job there getting into an argument with the manager of the restaurant. But in actuality, the owners, one of his partners, were very, very kind and they really liked me a lot. And I shouldn't have never let that situation get to that point. What's something you feel goes with that? have that's probably my biggest you know regret or what I feel is guilty about probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make was to join the military I had heard a lot of bad things about it I've heard good things about it but at At that particular time in my life, I had a fork in the road and I had to choose whether to go left or right and I chose to go left and join the Army. It turned out it wasn't that bad of a decision. Tell me about Meno or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Having been arrested years and years ago, it's 20 years to be exact and it hasn't really affected me employment wise or anything like that but it's it was on my record and uh it was something that should have been avoided but it happened and uh i just wish i could take that one back yes How old were you when you were 21? Why did you decide to move to Minnesota? in my college experience so I thought I'd try it. Yes. No, but I came close. I worked, I was in the military when The Russians were still prevalent in Eastern Europe and we did some border duty between East and West Germany and there were a few incidences on the border that could have gotten out of hand but never did. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Fairly easy. Since leaving the military in 1990, I find myself not being able to kind of interact with people as much as I used to. You know, being that I was in the military, you'd think that would be a little easier having lived with people so close to you all the time, but it actually made me a little bit more anxious and have a little bit more anxiety around people. I'm sorry to interrupt. What did you do after the military? I came back to Los Angeles and decided to move to Georgia and spent four years in Georgia and going to school a little bit and then came back to Los Angeles four years later after 1990. On a positive side I was physically fit when I got out very physically fit and I enjoyed being that way for several years until some things happened in my life to where I kind of let myself go. But it changed me. It made me more orderly. Pull out things in perspective. emotionally pretty good physically tired if anything I would say just thoughts of wanting to have more and do more in my life that's about it I usually go to sleep and sleep well. Some nights I toss and turn but it's rare. I wouldn't say it's rare but once I get to sleep, I sleep fairly well. What are you like when you're not sleeping? It's a little irritable in the mornings but since I live alone, a lot of people don't really feel that. So, but, you know, when my kids are around, it's more enjoyable to wake up because, you know, I can see their faces and enjoy their company. Yes. No, I haven't actually been diagnosed with depression but I have bats of that every now and then. Alright, when was the last time you felt really happy? Fairly recently. I had my kids over for the weekend and we had a good time enjoying each other's company so I was pretty happy then. That's good. Who's been a positive influence in your life? I would probably say a pastor from my church. Her name is Pastor Beverly Allen. She's been kind of a mentor for me for several years, and she's been a really big influence in my life and always kind of been there for me. How would your best friend describe you? Hopefully well. They would say I was funny, reliable, steady, and primarily an upbeat person. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. I like to bowl. So when we go bowling, a bunch of guys will go out and we'll go bowl and just have a good evening and enjoy each other's company and try to kick each other's butt on the bowling. Nice. What are you most proud of in the world? What are you most proud of in your life? My children. My pride and joy. They are an extension of me. Once I pass away, they will live on. I will live on through them. It's just an honor to know that I have three healthy children that are happy, very intelligent, and maybe make a good mark in society.

Meeting new people, kind of having that experience of being in the moment all the time because everything is so new and just kind of getting my my routine shaken up a little bit temporarily my trips um probably the best one maybe was when I went to Costa Rica with like like seven or eight other friends and then four of us went on to go to Guatemala I'm sorry um Panama to an island off Panama and just amazing just a total new world you totally new cultures off the beaten path, it was nothing I'd never seen before, so it opened up my eyes to the world a little bit.

Right now, I am deciding or figuring out if I'm going to be doing basketball as a career or if I'm going to be doing IT networking type stuff as a career. What's your dream job? Hmm. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? It kind of depends. probably 65% shy and 35% outgoing. I I I don't know. I think I just like to kind of take take things slow and get to know someone a little bit first before I open up to them. But sometimes I'm just in a real gregarious mood. It just kind of flows out of me, and I'm just, like, talking to everyone. But usually I kind of hang back a little bit and get a feel for a person before I open up to them. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Sometimes when I'm here in town, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not bloody, but it's the best it does. What do you do to relax? Meditate now has been tremendously helpful. Play hoops. I write. I go on a journal. And I talk to someone that I care about, that I know that I love them. How long do you keep them in your pocket? Probably too good. I think I keep things inside maybe sometimes. I'm pretty patient. I kind of put it all on my shoulders. well yeah you know once or twice things built up and I didn't express them so it eventually led to like erratic behavior because it kind of came out and like spurts or like bursts and a bunch of stuff was like unleashed at once instead of you know normally something happens it gets released in this case when something got released it was like a hundred things got released at once because they'd all been saved up The last time I argued with someone was probably with... Tell me about a situation that you wish you had known differently. When I broke up with my girlfriend before I was deployed overseas. Yeah, I didn't that, the way I handled that. I kind of just left and pretended not to care anymore. And she didn't deserve that. Her family didn't deserve that. It's been pretty good to me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Talk. Talk. I wish I could erase. Yes. 18 because I am I want to serve my country was or New York New Yorkers him 17 in I you want to college So, why not serve my country? Yes, all in all, yes, it was tough, it was tough, but I needed to get that dose of reality. it was kind of a pretty drastic change from like I wish there had been more of a gradual increase in the intensity of the experience because I got a little overwhelmed at times but it made me stronger in the end yes How easy was it for you to get the experience? It took me, I mean it took me, you know, let's say like a few, maybe five or seven years to completely kind of assimilate my experience. But only like, I mean, the first six months after I got out of the Army was a little strange. I kind of just did nothing because everything had been so structured for so long that I was just like, I'm living on my own schedule. I'm not doing anything. And yeah, and then, you know, it took me some time after that just to kind of figure out what I wanted to do in life. What did you do after the military? I went back to school and, or went, I mean yeah, went to college for the first time. Started playing basketball again for college and basically kept that up. Um, last couple years I just started coaching basketball and doing some computer training, learning how to do networks, computer networking. And that's it. Now I'm right here. and now i'm writing a book all really good really free concrete future now for the first time long time uh... it's been a little bit uh... whatsoever on the edge you know not not like since I mean the biggest thing that changed my behavior was starting to meditate for sure so did that for the first time about three years ago and that that pretty much brought me back to myself when kind of like you know when I consider to be like my kind of my true self so that definitely changed my behavior I was now I'm acting more from my heart instead of reacting to my thoughts about the past and the future. How easy is it for you to sleep? Nine times out of ten, I sleep pretty great. When I don't sleep well, it's pretty clear. I'm pretty quiet. I keep to myself. I don't have that sparkle. I don't have that attack energy. That energy to go out and get it. That's kind of how I'm feeling right now. little bit tired didn't sleep that great last night so I went to bed late no I'm gonna go to bed like 9 10 o'clock last night I went to bed at like 1 o'clock and that's hoping to play move so yeah today I'm feeling I'm a little bit like black Now, I'm not really... Have you been diagnosed with this? No, I've never been diagnosed. I went through a period where... you know, the first two or three years after I was in the army, and I kind of wanted life to be the way it was before I had joined the army, things that seemed, the world seemed a lot simpler then to me, and a lot more manageable, and then I got hurt while I was playing basketball, and I um you know so I couldn't like play hoops for a while for like two years and I'd say like I was pretty I was pretty down during that period but I was the thing was I was always I had one foot in the down the down zone but my other foot was in like how do I get myself out of this predicament. Like, I never, like, gave up hope. I mean, there was, there's flashes, like, thoughts will flash, like, every, every one long once in a while, where it's like, what's the point? You know, like, I'm gonna just die at the end anyways. So why, so why fight? You know, why struggle? Um, but, in general, no, it's 99.999% of the time. Gotta just go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best I can. Well, I was, I mean, I was pretty happy last night when I saw my own girlfriend and I got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about something physical. and I was pretty happy when I first got into LA a week ago and I made it to Venice and I was playing hoops and it was sunny and I was beautiful and I was free I had my car had no agenda had money in the bank when was the last time I was ecstatically happy? that's tough probably you know probably when I went on that trip to well there were some moments about two years ago me and my brother and my sister went on a trip together to the Dominican Republic that was um, definitely the, definitely, yeah, the girl that was my, um, my first love, like, She was a great person. She had a really, really good heart. And I kind of... My best friend probably thinks that, like, you know, I'm this, like, funny, cool guy that's like gonna be a movie star someday or something and like take everyone on like trips and like just like make everything fun for everyone else that's great tell me about something that you think is really interesting playing basketball on Venice Beach it's my it's either my first I mean it's either first or tied for first place to play to play basketball in the hole that I've ever played and that was I was at yesterday I played yesterday Against a bunch of guys And uh And it was just great It was just magical It's I love it I love the people I love the The craziness That comes through there People on bikes With boom boxes People in clown suits People Freaking Just doing all kinds of stupid stuff In the background People on the boardwalk Walking by Checking it all out All those people running around making things interesting and playing basketball amidst all of that it was great yeah you're welcome Adios",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/627_P/627_AUDIO.wav,1
628,22,1," Okay, so if you can put it on like this, like in the back of your head. Yeah, that's what you remember. Is this okay? Yeah, yeah. It's just supposed to be away from your mouth. Okay. Not this place. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to bring Ellie up for a second. Ellie? Oh, what a pretty name. Does it stand for anything, I wonder? I don't know. Oh, okay. I'm pretty impressed. I probably am. No, it's just a name. Oh, okay. And do you remember from last time? So she uses a series of, oh, yeah, well, last time it was controlled by a person. Oh, that's right. She uses a series of equations once she recognizes what you say to discover or realize what to say back to you. Okay, cool. And also the view camera and the system can use facial tracking. Oh, I got it. It has your expression. Okay. Yeah. Alrighty, Ellie, let's go. Very soon. I don't want to forget anything. No problem. No problem. No problem. So it's tracking my facial stuff right now. I probably not until like she's actually up. Oh, okay. It's just basically whether you smile or not. That is so neat. Oh, okay. Oh, hi. Okay. Okay. Okay. So she's going to ask you a series of questions. She can't answer any questions. Okay. Because the program is still in development. Okay. And then when she's done, she should say goodbye. Okay. the doorbell and I'll come back in. But if she stops for more than 10 to 15 seconds, there might be a glitch. So you should ring the doorbell. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your answers are totally confidential. Okay. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine, thank you. That's great. Where are you from originally? Where are you from originally? California. San Pedro, California. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather of course. I really love the weather. Also this is where all my family lives so it's good to be around your family. There's a lot to do out here. Do you travel a lot? I wouldn't say a lot. Like maybe once or twice per year. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Memorable? In a good way, I would say having my children. I have three children, so I guess that's the most memorable. What do you study at school? Right now I'm just doing liberal arts, so general studies. Nothing specific. I do take a lot of science classes because eventually I do want to pursue education in psychology, but that's later on. Okay. What's your dream job? shy just takes me a little bit longer to warm up I don't know I just like to read people before I really open up to them to see how much I'm willing to share and how much I'm not willing to share Um, it's okay. I mean, I love my family. We have our ups and downs. Um, specifically, I guess with my mother, you know, there's a little bit more ups, but I'm the only girl, so it's expected. I have three brothers, so with that being said, it is what it is. It's good when it's good, and when it's not good, it could be better. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best of God. What do you do to relax? Probably watch TV or, you know, sometimes I might pick up a book or something, magazine, see what's going on in fashion, just something to keep my mind off things. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. Oh, I also play games. I like to play games on my phone or on the computer, things like that. I wouldn't say I have a temper, you know, just average. You know, when things upset me, I deal with them, but I don't overdo it. I don't, you know, explode or anything like that. um probably what's today friday probably let me see was it yesterday no day before yesterday actually it was with my mom which is so funny um the argument was about she feels that because i'm a mother a wife and a mother that I should not have a social life meaning I should be at home knitting or something I don't know so it was small though it wasn't a big argument just you know I mentioned that I may go to a comedy event and she was against it I said well it's really not your decision I'm an adult so that was about it that's about it recently probably let me think oh probably should have you know oh i know when my husband was and i were discussing relocating from California I basically put my foot down and said I wasn't you know willing to do that and I probably should have kept an open mind because there are some pros to moving or relocating but I guess at the time I really just didn't want to hear it so I just put my foot down and said you know we're not going anywhere we're staying here I probably should have been more understanding because he is from you know he's not from California so he's probably feeling a little homesick and I should have took that into consideration guilty probably not spending as much time with my kids it's not because I don't want to spend time with them well meaning not all together like usually when I spend time with my children it's separate we're not always together unfortunately because my middle son has autism so he takes a little bit more time so I wish that you know we could all be together and I do feel guilty about that but it's difficult so I try to give them their own individual time the hardest decision you've ever had to make? Hardest decision? Probably, oh, I know. My former occupation, my former job, relocated, probably about an hour and a half away, something like that, a little bit over an hour depending upon traffic, and it was a good paying job, great benefits, great people, but I had to basically lay myself off from that job, which did create a financial hardship in my family but I didn't have a choice because of our you know situation with our son and having only one vehicle for transportation and just a lot of other factors you know I basically had to stop working and that was a big decision but you know I always say happiness over finances you know you can all I can always you know find another job but you know having my family together and being happy that's a different story that's about it oh that's easy probably when I had my face injured when I was in the military yeah I wish I could erase that I mean something that I see every day when I look in the mirror I don't dwell on it. It's just there, but it is a mark on my face that I didn't deserve You know it was a traumatic experience, but it's been about About 15 years or so. It's been quite a while If I could erase it yeah, that would be it Yes, I was in the Navy for four years. I didn't have any other options. I really wasn't planning on joining the military but I just didn't want to go back to school at the time. I figured going to the military would give me the background that I needed and money for school. that's the route that I chose. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, can't change it. I mean, I'm not unhappy. I met a lot of nice people, you know, so that was good. But there was some, you know, issues that I had in the military that if I had not went, you know, probably would have, you know, went a lot differently. But, you know, you can't change the past. Oh, right. Did you ever see combat? No. I'm glad I did it. I'm not really a combative type person. So, yeah, it's unfortunate, you know, but no, I did it. I'm sorry. How easy was it for you to get back to civilian life? The transition, it was a little difficult at first, you know, having to adjust, having to find a, you know, career and, you know, just not having that, how do you say, I guess I felt like comfort in the military because I knew that I was always going to have that paycheck, you know, as long as I did what I was supposed to do, I would always have, you know, a roof over my head, you know, things like that, you know, the civilian life, you know, you basically, it's hit or miss, you don't know, Like, you could lose your job one day or, you know, whatever. So, I don't know. It's an all right transition. I got used to it pretty quickly. That's good. Thank you. What did you do after the military? I went to school. I started working with a communications company. I did some medical care as well. Got married. Had children. That's about it. How did serving in the military change you? It made me a little bit more responsible. I know that for a fact. People my age at the time didn't have a lot of responsibility. Most of them were still living at home. At an early age, I was out on my own, paying my own bills, things like that. it did give me a little bit more responsibility. I'm feeling okay. I don't really have any complaints. I mean, I feel fine. I don't have any complaints about my life. You know, it is what it is. one day at a time. That's about it. Have you ever seen a change in your life? Uh, yeah, probably. Nothing really to speak about. Changes in thoughts. Yeah, a little bit. Nothing dramatic. When I'm ready to go to sleep, I usually go right to sleep. Well, not as soon as my head hits the pillow, but you know I don't toss and turn or anything like that very cranky very cranky a little irritable I guess no not at all No, not at all. I feel like I'm always happy. I don't know. People tell me that all the time. They say I'm always smiling and things like that. So probably this morning when I woke up. Thank you. Thank you. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mother. As much as we argue, you know, she's such a strong person. And, you know, she's really been there for me and my kids. I just love who she is as a person. You know, she's always doing things for people. She's, you know, a good person. She means well. But she's very opinionated. Probably silly. I don't know. How would she describe me? She'd probably say, sometimes I'm a little gullible. I don't think I am. That's what she would probably say. I don't know. Could be. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. I went on our family vacation. We actually drove, which was different. We usually fly. So it was a new experience, you know, going on the road with the kitties. Nice. Thank you. What are you most proud of in your life? Wow, that's a tough question. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Oh, I didn't really... Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Oh, you're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Should I press the button? Hi. That last question, I didn't really answer it, but she said, thanks. Got it. So I left it at that. She's the most proud of like, I don't know. Then she said, well, thank you for telling me. I was like, oh, shoot. I was like oh I was trying to get an answer okay sorry oh it's recording I just yawned sorry they're gonna think I'm bored no okay",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/628_P/628_AUDIO.wav,1
629,20,1," She's going to ask you some questions, and then you're just going to respond normally, and then she's going to use speech recognition technology to understand what you said, and then she uses a very complex series of equations established by our researchers here to respond to you and keep the conversation going. Okay. And she also uses software that incorporates the webcam and the Xbox Kinect. Well, it's all interactive. Yeah, to recognize your facial expressions and your posture. That way she can take your feelings into account. Absolutely. Will she pick up on my... If I do something? Yeah, so your body language, as you can see down here, that's the Xbox Connect read. So she uses that as well. I'm going to go ahead and just loop this behind your ear, just so it doesn't fall off. Interaction, and this one as well. Perfect. Is that okay? Yeah. Great. So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to start her up here. You're going to see her for a second, and then I have to shrink her back down as I continue setting up our recording equipment. Okay. Let me just spit that out. Oh, okay. That's better. So, two things. Yes. One is that, you know, she's still in development. So right now, unfortunately, she can't answer your question. She can only ask. And then the second thing is, as you will notice, there are some pauses as the interview progresses because she's trying to give you some time to answer. If there's a pause of 10 seconds or more, I'd like you to go ahead and press this button and alert me. Okay. Because every once in a while, we're going to have a pause. So, I'm going to go ahead and press this button and alert you. Okay. And then I'm going to go ahead and press this button and alert you. Okay. And then I'm going to go ahead and press this button and alert you. Okay. And then I'm going to go ahead and press this button and alert you. Okay.

And then I'm going to go ahead and press this button and alert you. Okay. Because every once in a while we're dealing with technology and we're still perfecting it. So there's a chance that things might pick up. And I just want you to be sitting here and waiting for her to say goodbye. Absolutely. Okay. So hopefully that won't happen, but I just wanted to give you a heads up. Okay. So we'll wait a few seconds here while this continues to set itself up. And so she's going to ask you a series of questions. And then at the end she'll say goodbye. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Ready? Mm-hmm. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing quite well. Where are you from originally? I am from West Covina, California. The sports teams. I like the Lakers, the Dodgers, and the USC football, and the weather. And the weather. The traffic. I don't like the traffic at all. And other than that, that's probably, probably, probably it. it. Do you travel a lot? No, not right now. I am in a job that just commute back and forth about 12 miles. So that's about the extent of my traveling. What do you enjoy about traveling? What do I enjoy about traveling? Probably seeing new places when I do travel. Seeing new places, seeing people from different states, different countries, and picking up on their cultures. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. of my trips let's see I have a friend in Atlanta Georgia and he works for the TV network down there and when the Dodgers were playing in Atlanta I took a trip to go see him and we went to go see the games as well Atlanta is a good nice sports town hot and muggy but we can deal with it it's much like here the The expressways are about the same traffic. They have their own traffic problems. But it was a really good experience. I got to see and meet people from Atlanta, Georgia and it was a really nice time. One of my most memorable experiences is being in the Marine Corps and liberating Kuwait. That was probably one of the best experiences of my life. We had little resistance and traveled from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait and liberated Kuwait city and it was great. What did you study at school? What I studied at school basically was broadcasting and radio because I was a radio operator in the Marine Corps so I studied broadcasting but I also love history. What do you do now? What do I do now? I am a part-time broadcaster for and it is and basically an operator engineer and run all the programming from satellite sources and and live programs. What is my dream job? Good question. Probably similar to what I had in the Marine Corps. I was a sergeant in the Marine Corps. I had my own squad. So if I could have been a management position where I have my own crew and take care of my own crew and look after their needs. That would probably be my dream position. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? It depends on the kind of mood I'm in. Sometimes I feel shy and just want to stay home. Other Other times I'm a little outgoing. I want to go out with my friends and go to dinner and have drinks and watch a sporting event. Why? Why because I'm feeling good and I want to feel company of my friends and just want to talk and converse. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my family. My mother is like one of my best friends. I confide in her with basically all of my problems and good things. My dad is a very good man. We get along very well. I have three sisters that, two of them I see on a regular basis. One of them I really don't, but we're all, we're a close family. What do I do to relax? In my apartment complex I have a jacuzzi so I spend 20 minutes in the jacuzzi and I go for a swim afterwards or I will go on a bike ride. I have my own mountain bike and I like to travel 5 miles and get a workout in. So when I'm feeling tense I go get a workout. How are you at controlling your temper? Good question. Sometimes it's very hard, but I have to look at myself and limit myself on what the possible consequences of an uproar, of my uproar, could lead to. So whether it be with my family or my coworkers, I have to always look at myself before I get very angry and temperamental. Has that gotten you in trouble? No I don't think so, no. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? question. Last time I got into an argument was probably with my dad. I go visit my parents and they have a pool and upon trying to clean the pool we had a disagreement so we had an argument. A situation where I wish I was... let's see... I was downsized from a full-time position back in December of 2012 and I think I could have probably avoided it if I read the signs. Probably worked a little harder and probably, I don't know, done a better job at that position. What's something you feel guilty about? Something I feel guilty about? Um, that's a good question. I don't think I feel really guilty. Everything I have done, I have lived up to and not felt guilty about. I haven't wronged anybody in particular, and not that I feel guilty. I don't feel guilty about anything. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I've ever had to make? Let's see. Probably when I was 17 years old, I signed a contract to join the Marine Corps and it was a six year contract. And I know that was probably a lot for my family, but it's something I wanted to do, but it was a really hard one. and I made it and I lived through it six years and I think I am better for it something I could erase from my memory Let's see. Let's see. I'm trying to think. Probably, I've gotten into two bar fights, so probably limiting the alcohol use at some of those times and avoided trouble. in the bars yes i was uh... pt i wanted the toughest challenge for an eighteen-year-old and I thought the uh... I knew that the Marine Corps would give it to me so I took it. Absolutely. Yes. Yes, I was in Desert Storm. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Pretty easy. I had to get used to growing my hair out again because I had it really short for six years. And I really didn't like getting haircuts every week. Other than that, I went to, as soon as I got out, I went to broadcasting school and everything pretty much went back to normal. What did you do after the military? I went to broadcasting school and then I got a radio job in Palm Desert, California. And that was my first radio job. I worked there for three months and I got a job in Riverside. So after that I kept getting jobs and until now I've worked in radio for 22 years. Okay. How did serving in the military change you? It changed me because I am more disciplined, self-disciplined. I pay attention to detail, more attention to detail than I ever have. It's kind of a mental thing, paying attention to detail, but they drilled it into our heads. Pretty cleanly, I like to keep everything in its place, and I like to keep fit, the way they taught me. How have you been feeling lately? Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or confidence? No, I've always stayed pretty even keel and I like to keep it that way. I don't like to get too low or get too high. I like to stay even keeled. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It is pretty easy when I work out a lot. There are some times when I do a 5 mile bike ride and then I swim like 10 laps in the pool. Those days are easy for me to get a good night's sleep. And some of the other days where I just do a bike ride or a swim, but not both, those are pretty easy too. So, sometimes I have too much energy, but when I work out that energy, I soon do have a good night's sleep. What am I like when I don't sleep well? Well, I get up and I'm really groggy and tired and I have to have at least three cups of coffee. And that usually gives me the energy that I need for the whole day. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I have never have. I recently had a checkup from the VA and everything was perfect. So, I do not have PTSD. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Again, at my last physical, I was asked if I was feeling depressed and I told them no. They did tests and determined that I wasn't a depressed person. So I never feel depressed. I always feel even-healed and never feel depressed. Alright. When was the last time you felt really happy? team and I like to do like to see them succeed so basically it's baseball season right now but football season is around the corner and basketball season the hockey season so a big sports fan so one of my teams do well I am I am feeling really really good somebody that's been a positive influence in my life um i would say my parents um they've been married um since uh 1955 so uh we're going up on almost 70 years 60 years 60 years so um i think my parents my mom uh is a big influence and she's uh a very good woman and taught us to be very good people so I would say my parents. My best friend described me as determined, driven, and willing to succeed I would think. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something I did recently which I really enjoyed, let's see. I recently went to a baseball game with my boss and it was a couple weeks ago and we We had really good seats from the team and we had a great night. The food, we had hot dogs and french fries and the Dodgers won in the bottom of the night. So it was a really, really good game and it was a good experience. proud of being a Marine. I served six years in the Marine Corps and a Desert Storm veteran. So I achieved the rank of Sergeant at 22 years old. So I am grateful and most proud to be a United States Marine. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/629_P/629_AUDIO.wav,0
631,17,1," And now I'm going to bring up our virtual human just for a second here so you can see what she looks like. And then I'm going to shrink her back down as I continue setting everything up. I'm going to go ahead and put this behind you. Just going to look over your ears just like that. Perfect. Yeah. It's the same one. Make sure this doesn't get in your way. There we go. Perfect. Just like that. Great. There she is. So I'm going to shrink her back down and things are going to keep setting up here. So just a couple of caveats before we get started. This is relatively new technology, so unfortunately Ellie doesn't, she's our virtual human, she doesn't quite yet have the capability to answer questions, so she'll be the one asking all the questions today. Also, you'll notice that she does pause sometimes here and there to listen to what you're saying. If you notice a pause that's later than about 10 seconds, I'd go ahead and press this button.

Where are you from originally? I'm originally from Orange County, California. And now I live in Los Angeles. What are some things you really like about LA? I went to college here so I enjoy the fact that a lot of my friends are still around. So just the ability to see them and be able to hang out with them is really good. And obviously the weather has been amazing all the time. So those are the few things I like about LA. Right. Obviously traffic. And I don't know. I think traffic is the main reason. And aside from that, I don't have much to complain. Do you travel a lot? I used to for my old job but not anymore. So I'm pretty much based in LA most of the time. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just the ability to see other things and explore new things, whether it be going to a new sightseeing area or trying different kinds of food. Just the fact that I'm encountering something else or something new is something I enjoy about traveling. And obviously the people that I am with when I am going traveling because I rarely travel by myself. So, you know, whether I travel with my boyfriend or friends, the fact that I have companions that I enjoy spending time with is something I enjoy. Sure, I, for the 4th of July past weekend, or two weekends ago, I actually went to San Francisco to visit my boyfriend. So we actually, he was moving from LA to San Francisco, so we drove up to the Bay Area, saw his family, and then stayed with my friend, who recently moved into a new apartment in Oakland. So we hung out with her, spent a day in the city, went to the ferry building, went to the fisherman's wharf, and hung out and went shopping. So although it was kind of a bittersweet goodbye because we are now, I'm now in LA and he's in San Francisco, but it was a really fun trip. What's one of your most memorable experiences? the past trip or just in general? I studied mathematics and economics. I am actually I just quit my job last Friday I'm taking some time off before I go back to graduate school. What's your dream job? on my own or as I have a hobby but I want to have a job that would give me the flexibility to pursue what I want to do outside of my professional life. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Why? I don't know when I meet new people or when I just hang out with people in general. not I'm not shy to speak about my feelings or you know ask questions or engage in a conversation initiate a conversation so I don't consider myself shy. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Sure um my family and are pretty close they're back in Orange County but I've been living apart from them for about already four years but I still visit them almost every other weekend. We go out to dinner and then I hang out with my mom. We have our shopping trips and spa days once in a while so we get to bond. So I think I have a pretty close relationship with my family. Most importantly my mom, she's like almost like my best friend. sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screen saver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best big guy right what do you do your last um i work in the entertainment industry um and i work at a youtube production studio which we make content for YouTube vloggers or whatever you will call it so I just kind of go on YouTube and look at my favorite YouTube vlogs from people it's kind of like a mini reality show so I think it's pretty fun other than that I just kind of go through my old pictures to think about like fun times I've had for example from my trip to Costa Rica last year with my boyfriend or my trip to San Francisco with my friends or just kind of think about like good times I've had in the past or also I enjoy like exercising or being in nature so I would go for a hike in Santa Monica or something like that I think I'm pretty good I've never had a situation when I was out of control or you know I was I was acting like I wasn't myself I think um when I don't know I don't think I've actually never had a situation when I was I wasn't able to control my temper I just kind of stay calm and think about the situation and think about how I'm going to respond to it and try to respond to it wisely. Let me think. I don't know. I can't really remember the last time I argued with someone. maybe when I argued with my old roommate about our friendship kind of so we had a conversation about how both of us are kind of drifting apart from each other but it was more of a conversation than an argument so we were able to I mean both of us are kind of like getting heated up by the topic but we were able to just kind of cool down and talk about the situation and talk things through oh yeah sure um so i remember um a few months ago a friend of mine visited from washington dc and we went to a different friend's house in hollywood so when i was there there was this guy who kind of was very confrontational with me about what i do or what i want to do or my stance on certain topics for example it was education and then and he started kind of saying like oh you know you're not secure about the way you are blah blah blah so I kind of was I kind of got angry at him and I just told him like you're not giving me a good first impression and you're top like what you're saying doesn't make sense and I kind of like was very um argumentative with him, I wish that I was more calm and was able to kind of probe more on why he thought that way instead of attacking him verbally. What's something you feel guilty about? Guilty? I'm guilty about quitting my job too early. I'm going back to graduate school in the fall so I was actually supposed to stay a little later till end of July but hey I wanted to enjoy my time and just be unemployed for a little bit so I ended up quitting my job a little early which is a burden on my boss so that's something I feel guilty about Sure, I can talk about my recent graduate school preparation process. I was deciding between going to Berkeley, which is in the Bay Area, and UT, which is in Boston. Like I mentioned before, my boyfriend lives in the Bay Area, and then if I were to go to Berkeley, I can be together with him in the same area, but I think once I got the acceptance letter from the city I knew that I wanted to go there just right away so I had to decide between being with my boyfriend and being complacent and kind of comfortable in California versus venturing out into different city different state different people different environment and be in be in Massachusetts and I ended up deciding with Although it's far away from my parents, family, friends, boyfriend, but I wanted to explore something else and be in a different environment. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't know if I have anything I want to completely erase from my memory. Maybe when my great grandma passed away when I was in the 8th grade. I remember I was in a different room, but my grandma passed away in a different room. But had I stayed there with her, I could have kind of seen her pass away, but I didn't get to do that because I was watching TV in some other room and just hanging out. I wish I could erase that from my memory because it was kind of a traumatic event in my life. Have you ever served in the military? No, I haven't. How were you in the military? I've never served in the military. Why did you decide to join the military? Oh, I did not. I have never served. Were you happy to do that? Oh, I wouldn't know because I didn't enlist in the military. Did you ever see combat? No. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? I've never served in the military. I didn't serve in the military I didn't serve in the military How have you been feeling lately? Good. Can you tell me about that? You know, just I quit my job, I had a good going away party, I'm getting ready for grad school a lot of exciting things ahead so I'm excited and happy not really I think I've been a lot more positive than before How easy is it for you to get into sleep? Very easy. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm grumpy and I eat a lot more and I drink a lot of coffee. no no I have not Two months ago when I got my acceptance call from my dream school. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I think first and foremost my mom. she's always reminded me of who I am and you know why I am on this earth and it sounds kind of philosophical but she's been my foundation How would your best friend describe you? They would say energetic, kind of intense sometimes, outgoing, and yeah. Tell me about something that you really enjoyed. I enjoyed when I went hiking two days ago and I went with my friend Stephanie. It was a two-hour hike. It was a lot of fun and I always love hiking, so that was something I really enjoyed recently. Nice. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm most proud of the fact that I was able to acclimate myself into a new environment. I actually came here when I was 13, so the fact that I got to where I am in life, despite not learning how to speak the language about 10 years ago, that is something that I'm very, very proud of. Okay, I think I've asked everything I needed to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/632_P/632_AUDIO.wav,0

And it's entirely automated by the computer and no one's controlling her in the back. And the reason we have the webcam and the Kinect is so that the system can also recognize your facial expressions and your posture. I'm not too sure. My shirt? Yeah. Thanks.

I actually met up with friends at some bars actually went I'm a foodie so I went to a couple of restaurants I heard about on the food network um I took a boat ride and I visited some friends so I really had a good time I have several of those but one of my most memorable experiences in life would be um the day that Barack Obama became president that was a memorable experience for me and I wish that a lot of my family members who have passed on was here to see that that would always stay with me like a tattoo is a very memorable moment that that'll never be forgetting it'll go down in history and it is history and it's just a great experience for me and other people like myself to know that we have transitioned beyond race and that well in some ways and that you know anyone can become president and really fulfill their dreams there's no limits well depends on okay I am a dispatch manager the last school I attended was and I have my degree in Homeland Security and investigations I work for a private security firm. I'm actually overseeing about 12 to 20 people a day. I work various hours and my job is very tedious. I do a lot of problem solving and it makes the night go by fast. I work from 10 30 to 6 30 and within the dispatch center I should say a command center that I oversee we do dispatch and also surveillance. So half of the night we're looking at 20 cameras for corporate and residential accounts and also dealing with supervisors and security officers who actually are at a site and we put them in what's called a mobile vehicle or mobile van where they stay on site until the actual site is ready and developed for people to come through after construction. So we make sure that we obtain and make sure these places are very well rounded with security. We do a lot of observing and reports, so any information, anything that's happening on site for the security officers, they allow us to know about it. I do everything from inventory to attendance, talking to other locations out of state, making sure our data information in our systems are updated, computer software. So anything you think about, I'm actually involved in as far as the company is concerned. So it's a very tedious but very rewarding position. Okay, what's your dream job? My dream job is completely opposite from what I have now. I've been writing songs since I was about nine years old. It started when I was in the junior choir at church. and I've always had a passion for that. I feel like that runs through my bloodstream. Music is, there's a song I would always say for every situation and occasion and I feel like music runs through my bloodstream. It's just a part of my DNA and who I am and my dream job would be an engineer who owns their own record label and a very big time songwriting slash producer. oh i'm definitely not shy that's not me at all i'm a very expressive person as you can probably hear uh i've never been shy a day in my life but i'm more outgoing more uh blunt i would say that's just who i am uh i just feel like you know as people we're all you know made up of different characteristics and personality traits and i just like expressing myself i talk a lot i get that from my father and i just you know what i what i feel i feel like i should put out there and voice my opinion like anyone else that's just who i am interesting that's a good question um i listen to music but i like to go to the beach and taking the whole scenery just to smell the ocean you know water you know that that um the whole experience of my feet in the sand looking around just taking in the small things just you know appreciating the breeze i do stuff like that when i get a chance to but sometimes a glass of wine or just watching tv having a conversation sometime praying you know whatever about anything that goes on with my family so it's different things i do and shopping always helps too is very therapeutic for me that's number one I would say pretty good I would say um in my 20s I would have a different answer for you I was more quick-tempered I'm pretty good with that yes I do get upset and angry about things uh depends on what it is um but i just think what when you grow and you become you know uh you know you get older you know not always maturity doesn't always come with age and knowledge and i feel like as i've grown as a person i'm a lot older now more calm and more centered about things so i don't get as angry as i used to it is a better way to deal with things besides getting angry a couple of days ago and i argued with my ex-girlfriend uh over the state of things in our past relationship that still bothers us both and we're just trying to get to a point where we can communicate better we say things when we're angry we're still hurt about things we're trying to work through so that was the last argument I had um there's so many of those I wish I would have handled uh a lot differently um wow so many of those situations I wish I would have handled differently um hmm good question i'm sorry for taking so long it's just so many things i i think about um wow handled differently i don't know that's such a hard question but you know i i can't answer that question for you um I give you a plain example I was I think maybe 18 years old and or 19 and my brother's a couple years younger than me my dad is uh physically abusive and he was never there for us he was the type of father who just kind of came around my mom would let him whoop us or he'll show up whenever he wanted to but he wasn't a substantial father that was active in our lives and one particular time I guess my mom had told my dad that my brother was having company without permission and he went over there and he beat him up really bad the only reason I knew was because I was working for my mom at her hair salon and he brought him up there black and blue and bloody and I felt like I had a nervous breakdown I didn't handle that well I felt like I I should have been there to protect him I hope I'm not gonna cry because it still bothers me I feel like I should have been there to protect him and I wasn't and it bothers me I take on a lot that bothers me I wasn't there when it happened and I called um social services and told them what happened and I just wish I would have took him to the hospital and I broke down and I just wish I would have been there for him and that bothers me and I just feel like I should have dealt with it better just took him to the hospital instead of going in the bathroom and crying and that bothers the hell out of me to this day just what I said about my brother um I just wish I was there for him when that happened and I wasn't and I blame myself for it but I I feel guilty about not being there for my ex-girlfriend financially at the time I couldn't get to Vegas so I couldn't be there for her when she was in hospital and sometimes she couldn't be there for me but it just I take a lot on my shoulders and I blame myself for stuff I know that I can't control but I feel guilty about that very about that and so many other things my grandfather um frank passed away and he was a great grandfather and i used to ask some family members where he was because i didn't know where he was located where he moved to new phone numbers anything and over the years i always asked what happened to him they knew the information and didn't tell me and then i found out years later that he passed away and he was asking about me and i feel bad but i didn't know how to find him where he was so those are some of the things i feel bad for it's a lot I give you one to play an example um no I've never served in the military at all but I can give an example of something um my mom um she does hair like I said she has her own hair well at one point she had her own hair salon I remember going to her shop one day just kind of hang out with her and she introduced me to a client of hers and I remember the lady saying oh I didn't realize you had a daughter I knew you had a son and this is the first time I heard that and it really got to me it hurt and I feel like there's no excuse for that and I didn't want her to explain and that just really hurt me to my core I talked to my dad about it I called him and he said oh just ignore it how do you ignore somebody saying that you don't even that you exist how to ignore that and a part of me sometimes wish I could just erase a lot of things she's done like that away because it still tends to bother me i have no military experience i've thought about in the past i've thought about it since i actually got my degree in homeland security and investigation i thought about becoming a police officer there's so many things i thought about getting into um but with a lot of freezes on certain positions i've applied for i just went a different direction that still had to do with uh some type of law enforcement like what i'm doing now but um never got into that i have no military experience i never signed up for the military just thought about it i well i never really never thought about if i happy i didn't enlist or not somewhat yeah um i'm happy with the way things are i don't think the military would actually be for me uh it's some good things about it like paying for college tuition always having uh and kind of fall back on gi bills uh experience of you know fighting for your country but do i think that was for me i'm kind of past um that at this point i think i'm past the age limit where you can even sign up for it so no I don't have any regrets no I have no experience in that so I don't know I don't know people that have been in the military like my family members, uncles and aunties that are still here or not here anymore. What did you do after the military? Never been in the military so I can't answer that question. Okay, how did serving in the military change you? I don't know, I just heard about what people have been through after they come out of the military but I have no idea. Over stressed, happy at moments, feeling sometimes defeated and insecure, hurt. um i spent a lot of time alone uh is it by choice no but good and bad it's not great yeah um happy a lot of times but there's moments where i'm really really sad as well too so they don't really balance each other out at all not at all i do so much tossing and turning for years i don't remember the last time i got a good amount of sleep until recently when i bought this brookstone pillow which has been helping but i'm still tossing and turning and then a lot of times i'll lay there i want to go to sleep and it just does not happen and i don't know why if it's my stress or what's going on but my sleep patterns are not great and I still get up and do what I have to do like I've had nine hours or so so that's just me active like I am now completely wide awake some days I'm fatigued and tired and a little sad but usually I'm just up and just being me and active and overly bubbly and a busy body normally usually Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? When was the last time you felt really happy? I felt really happy well sometimes you know in life because nobody's perfect there's things I get to I let get to me um I sometimes put the weight of the world on my shoulders and when you take care of everybody else sometimes you get lost in that transition and I just you I'm happy to have every day I thank God for every day I live and I'm at I'm up and I'm able to work and do things that I need to do for myself and I just felt happy and rested and I caught up on shows and I relaxed and I ate and I just had a good day of a peace and tranquility which is not um it's not a regular thing for me it's kind of rare to have those kind of days because so much is going on oh that's easy my grandmother she's been passed away for about 20 years now 20 plus I say she's been the backbone of who I am I'm so much like her as far as hard work and determined strong-willed I mean just the glue to kept the family together she was the backbone of our family and she's one of the she's my hero she did everything she you know she was so selfish she put everything on the back burner put everybody first do you get what i mean because that's what i'm doing too i know i get that from her uh just you know endless caring and loving i never had to question that and my grandmother even she was a rare commodity a rare person of so much goodness and i just appreciate everything she taught me she even paid for our public school I'm sorry for our private school and help my mom and my dad when they first got married years and years ago with a second car Will pick us up every day just did everything she could to help and was there for everybody and then some she is a great example of You know a human being that went beyond the call of duty to do everything she could for her family And she's my hero and i'm i'm really proud and honored to be a part of her bloodline and I miss her dearly I don't have one but if they if I did have one I would say they would say that I'm a loving person uh I love hard that I'm creative I'm funny articulate down to earth very blunt um a good friend and I value friendship you know um and I made mistakes sometimes you piss me off I can be a little mean and I could be sarcastic but overall a good person that's just too hard on herself and doesn't get herself enough credit and gets taken advantage of sometimes because of how nice I am if I had one I would think they would say that oh that's an easy one shopping i went to the mall and i shopped i shopped online i had so many packages coming from high heels to tennis shoes to jackets and cute very creative sexy dresses so shopping puts my mind out of everything that we talked about as far as my feelings of hurt or insecurity all that goes away because shopping is therapeutic and once i get an idea in my mind i'm coordinating colors and i just know what i'm gonna do this and that with i'm very uh creative and i like things out of the the norm so that just makes me if i could shop all the time that would be a dream nice thanks What are your most proud of in your life? else so I'm proud of my maturity level and my responsibilities",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/633_P/633_AUDIO.wav,1
634,18,1," Hold on. So, like I said, she's just going to ask you a few questions. She can't answer any questions right now. She can only ask them. Okay. Can we start the video right now? And when she's done, she should say goodbye. Okay. Okay. questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing good, thanks. That's great. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles, here in California. What are some things you really like about LA? What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the smog. I don't like the traffic. And that might be, those might be the things at the top of my list. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? We travel a little bit, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? We enjoy packing the kids up, getting them in a different environment, helping them to learn about different cultures and experiencing those cultures to the fullest and just getting away. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. A couple years ago, we took the kids to Acapulco for Thanksgiving. And it's not normally a time of the year that we travel, but we thought we'd try something different. And it was a great experience for them. We did all kinds of things that we normally would not have done. So it was an opportunity to sort of stretch our horizons and experience some new things and we actually had a really great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable experiences in terms of travel I guess was the time that my luggage got lost in Puerto Vallarta and I spent the week wearing my husband's shorts and t-shirt. What did you study at school? I went to fashion school for two years and then after that I got my bachelor's. What do you do now? Now I'm a real estate agent that has nothing to do with the subjects that I studied in college, but it's a great career nonetheless. What's your dream job? My dream job would still be in real estate, but it might be such that I have the financial means that I can just do it because I love it. I love helping people secure their first property. So I work with a lot of first-time buyers. It's their foyer into wealth management. I like educating people on the process. I would probably still want to be in the business of real estate. I might actually delve more into income property ownership, but it would still be something in real estate. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Definitely more outgoing. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I work out to relax. Usually three to five times a week I work out in the mornings and it does help to manage stress. In real estate and being a mom there is lots of stress in my life. How are you at controlling your temper? Getting better at it, not the best at it. I tend to be very outwardly with my emotions and am learning to try to check them at the door a lot more than I used to. So I'm a work in progress. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? It probably was, the person was probably my husband. And the time frame may have been a month or so ago. And quite honestly, I don't remember what it was about. So that tells you that it was probably something that was not even important. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I wish that I would argue with my husband less, especially in front of our kids. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about arguing with my husband in front of my kids. It's something that they should be apart from and separate from and not even be included in that. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. It was probably the decision to let my daughter move forward with the heart surgery that the doctor said that she needed. But it was a very scary time and place for us, but we moved forward with it. It was a decision that I did not make alone. I made it along with my husband. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. An event that I wish I could erase from my memory would be as a child being touched inappropriately by a family member. Have you ever served in the military? No. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling fine. Tell me more about that. I've been feeling fine this summer. The work stress is still there, but my kids are out of school, so our household is a lot more relaxed. My son is actually in Sacramento for the past couple of weeks, so it's just my husband and my daughter and I, and we're sort of taking a little bit of a laid-back approach to summer before our vacation comes up. Have you ever studied changes in your behavior? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm pretty easy over the last two to three weeks I think there was one night where I had so much on my mind I did find it hard to fall asleep but in general I do sleep well the workouts help with that as well What are you like when you don't speak well? Just sort of not as social, a little more quiet, lagging. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. No. When was the last time you felt really happy? Today or yesterday. Just the ability to be blessed to wake up every day and have an opportunity to make the best day that I can. That's a blessing so I'm happy about that every day. day. My mother is definitely a positive influence in my life. She is someone that I go to in confidence all the time. She's a very spiritual woman and always seems to lead me or point me in the right direction. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend actually passed away, so I will use my husband, who is a really good friend actually, and at this point he is my best friend, and he would probably describe me as someone who lives my life passionately, who is very dedicated and loyal, and who wears her emotions on her sleeve. On Saturday, my husband, my daughter and I just, we were in Burbank handling some business and after that it was so hot and my daughter asked if we could go to Sherman Oaks Galleria to hang out and it was not something that was my choice, but it was just really nice to be able to hang out in a really casual environment and do something that she wanted to do and that really pleased her. And we went shopping and we had a really good time. But ordinarily, I would have never chose that activity. But because my husband and I were able to throw whatever other plans we had out the window and just enjoy her, it ended up being a nice family outing. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud of my children. I have a seven-year-old daughter and a nine-year-old son. And I'm very proud of the way that they are growing up and their character and their academic skills and really the little people that they have become. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/634_P/634_AUDIO.wav,1
635,36,1," I'm going to explain to you a little bit more about what I mean. So this is just kind of an overview of how this works. So she's going to ask you some questions, and then you're going to respond normally into the microphone. And then she uses speech recognition technology to understand what you've said and then uses a very complex series of equations that have been established here at ICT to decide how to respond back to you and keep the conversation going. She also uses software that incorporates the webcam and the Xbox Kinect to recognize your facial expressions and your posture so she can take your feelings into account as I introduce the rest of you as well. So I'm going to go ahead and bring her up for just a second so you can see what she looks like, and then I'm going to have to shrink her back down as I continue setting up some of our recording. She's cute. Is she single? She is. Hey. Oh, one caveat also, even if you try to ask her on a date, she's not sophisticated enough to respond back to your questions yet. That's alright, a lot of my dates aren't. It's never stopped me before. Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and start the hand quarter. And this is going to start here. Okay, so she's going to ask you some questions, and then when she's done, she's going to say goodbye, and then you're going to press this button to let me know that you guys are done. She's looking at me so flirtatiously. She nodded at you. Yep. Okay, so just a few caveats before we get started. We're working with technology here, and this is kind of a pilot project right now. So there is a chance that some things are not going to go perfectly. So if there is a pause where Ellie doesn't say anything for about 10 to 15 seconds, please press this button and let me know because it's probably an indication that something is going wrong. There's also a chance that you were working with speech recognition technology, which if you've ever used Siri on the iPhone, you know it's not perfect. So there's a chance that you may say something that she misunderstands and she might ask you some follow-up questions that don't pertain to what you just said. So just kind of bear with us. Hopefully everything will go smoothly, but I had to give you some caveats before we got started. Okay. So again, just press this button once she says goodbye. Okay. Okay? Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yep. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. How are you? That's great. Where are you from originally? Switzerland. What are some things you really like about LA? Do you travel a lot? No. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I don't know. I have to think about it. What comes to your mind? Um, I don't know. What did you study at school? Philosophy. What do you do now? Sales. What's your dream job? Acting. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Both. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Meditate. pretty good maybe too good um um maybe a month ago with my father I saw this girl in a store the other day and I wish I'd asked her out. Not calling my father. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Have you ever served in the military? How have you been feeling lately? Okay, a little tired. That's great. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Challenging. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired, crabby, low energy. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't remember. Tell me more about that. I don't remember. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Katherine Gately. Can you tell me about that? She's a teacher that I had. She loved me. How would your best friend describe you? Nice guy. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I had a date the other day. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? Nothing. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye.

636,62,2," I was just wondering if someone was there with her. Really? Interesting. I mean, I think that's the point. She surely was in fashion. Oh, you haven't talked with her yet. Okay, someone has to be here. You just look at others. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to start by doing this. All right. Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? All right. I suppose. Where are you from originally? Well, I was born in Philadelphia, but we lived all over the place, so I'm not from Philadelphia. I just was born there and lived there for a year. All right. What are some things you really like about the weather? I love the weather. People are generally more friendly than where I've lived on the East Coast. The scenery, the environment, the beach, the mountains, the bike paths, and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables. What are some things you don't really like about the city? The usual, the traffic. I guess some of the people in the entertainment business, a bit of the materialism and, you know, when you meet like the stereotypical dits. I used to when I used to have a life I've been to 41 countries and I really enjoyed that and wish I could do it again one day I guess since I'm from nowhere it's fun to go somewhere where it doesn't you don't have to fit in you're already a weirdo so it doesn't matter that you're not from the place and I just really enjoy meeting people from different cultures I love seeing new environments I love seeing historical things or you know just things of incredible beauty. I love meeting different types of people. Food. I love different food. So any foods from any foreign lands are always fun. And the other thing I secretly like that I try not to get too wrapped up in is that you can completely and utterly escape and forget about your real life? All right, let me think for a minute. Gee, I don't know which one to pick. I guess I'm trying to think in my head. I probably shouldn't be overthinking. I'm trying to think, do I pick a horrible one to give you guys more emotion, or do I pick a normal one? Although I'm not so sure. My traveling companion was my, you know, husband, who, I don't know what his story is. I suppose he's gay. So we went to Singapore, and it was just fabulous. I, except for the parts having to deal with him. I loved being there. You know, the variety of delicious, unbelievable food. I'm a huge curry laksa fan, so that was really fun. It's a big shopping place, so I kind of wished I were a bit younger because they had fabulous fashions. I like the weather because it was hot and steamy. It was really easy to get around, things like that. let's see for some reason i'm thinking of a bad one but it's nothing i assume you mean towards travel um when i was traveling through vietnam and cambodia i got a really bad case of hemorrhagic dengue fever um i i was in hoy no I wasn't I was in I was in Huey sorry in Vietnam and I was horribly sick and I was hallucinating and my traveling companion husband person um I I said please go get me some water I was you know really sweating profusely and I'd been very sick for a while and he went out to get the water I don't know it was sometime in the morning and he came back at I don't know seven o'clock at night or something and said that he'd some fellow on a motorbike had said let me take you somewhere where you can get some water and I don't know what the hell he did all day long so um I just think back to then and I remember coming in and out of consciousness and thinking I'm going to die here um and I wondered if I would ever be you know found in this this hotel we were staying so I don't know I survived and I'm probably over dramatizing it but But it was just memorable because I often think back when I see people sick or whatever and think, gee, why the heck did I survive? That's not my PTSD thing, though, if you're wondering. What did you study at school? I studied film as an undergrad. Well, I started off in dance, and then I realized I wasn't really that talented. I mean, I was okay, but not really that good. So I moved over to film, and I really enjoyed that. And then later on in life, I went back to school, and I became a lawyer. I'm an underemployed lawyer, I guess. I got tossed out with many people, you know. I now understand why the, what do you call it, the age discrimination laws kick in after 40. Well, you know, it's extremely difficult to get rehired. So now I have a couple of clients. I make a couple of pennies, you know. Would prefer to be fully employed. Not really going so well. that's why I'm here today to make my 35 measly bucks because after paying off all those loans and everything for law school because I stupidly picked one of the more expensive law schools in the country so any of you students listening don't do that I mean don't pick an expensive grad school if you don't get financial aid and you don't have financial help from your family um so anyway I because I was spent all my life paying off my undergrad and my graduate schools, I now find myself looking down the barrel of long-term unemployment and retirement and not having any, you know, any insurance or any, enough for a, what they say we're supposed to live to in the future. Alright, what's your dream job? I don't even know anymore. I don't, I don't have any dreams left. When I was younger, my dream job was to be an ambassador because I thought it would just be so much fun to, you know, have contact with different countries and to get to be friendly and meet people all the time and to represent your country in a positive way. I don't know. I don't think I have any dreams left. I'm too old. I have nothing that the world wants anymore. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Why? to say you're unemployed because people think I've had so many people say well why don't you just go out and get a job well or they assume that you're being lazy or something like that where it's like okay assholes I've worked since I was 12 you know I didn't have fun during college I worked three jobs to pay for it all and my loans um I don't know I guess I just stopped trying because and I'm a little embarrassed about my situation you know I'm quote unquote married to somebody who has this secret life. I don't know what his story is. I guess I'm embarrassed about my life being, you know, pretty much a complete and utter failure of every goal that I had. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen reader. I go for a bike ride along the lovely bike path. I go swimming on occasion. I will drink, have a drink. I have a low alcohol tolerance, so basically one or two will pretty much knock me out. I don't know. I used to do yoga and stuff like that. Nowadays, I try to do deep breathing. How are you a complete stranger? It depends who the person is. In a normal situation with normal people or with complete strangers, I'm pretty darn good at it. With two people, I'm no longer any good at it at all, my husband and my mother, because they were both extremely physically and emotionally abusive, and I finally learned in the last maybe 10 years or so that that's the stuff that I accepted as normal was not normal. So I did all the assertiveness thing where you say, please do not lie to me or whatever the thing they were doing, and the person's supposed to say, oh, I didn't know that was hurting you. Let me change. But of course that never actually works in real life. So now I find that if I must have contact with these people, which one of them I have to, I get extremely, you know, if they lie to me, I just get fed up and, you know, confront them on it. Well, well, can you give me a chance? I guess it was my husband. Since I'm paying the cell phone bill and he's on the family plan, And it turned out that he had 44 pages of texts while he's off on this secret trip to some summer camp. Don't ask. I don't even want to think about it. I don't know who these people are that he's texting with. So I asked him, what the F are these texts? Who are you doing this with? And I tried calling some of the numbers, and the people would just hang up on me. So, you know, my imagination started thinking, what the hell is he doing at this summer camp? Why do the people that he's texting and texting photos to not respond? You know, draw your own conclusions. So, you know, and he wasn't answering me, and he kept lying in these one-sentence emails he was sending back. So I, you know, I started giving these threats in the emails back, like, oh, yeah, well, if you don't tell me, I'm going to call up this number and find out who they were, which he wouldn't answer me. And then, as I said, I called, and they would just hang up on me. So who knows who these people were. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. Well, I mean, there are the general life ones, like I wish I had never married this person, a situation I wish I had handled differently. I guess I had a job. I actually was the head lawyer for a company. You probably won't believe it now, you guys who are out there watching this. And the president started doing all these things that were ethically wrong and going against my advice. And I should have gotten the Hades out of there. I should have quit immediately, but I was still paying off, you know, $200,000 worth of student loans. But I just should have gotten out of there. What's something you feel guilty about? Gee, willikers. Well, I guess the only real thing I feel guilty about is something I'd prefer not to discuss on tape. I mean, I've had enough shrinks tell me over the years that I was justified. Hardest decision I ever had to make? I don't know. I mean, every stupid, a lot of decisions have been difficult. The hardest one. I have no idea. The last 49 years? I guess I could erase my big PTSD. When I was 18, a serial killer abducted me, and I escaped from that. Have you ever served in the military? No, I haven't. How have you been feeling lately? I don't know. It's been a long... Tell me more about that. I don't know. Just neither here nor there. I'm just numb anymore. I don't really care. I'm just waiting for it, you know, to die. Have you noticed any changes in your life lately? Well, I kind of had a bad blow last week with something, and I just didn't have an appetite for like, I don't know, five days, and the horrible thing is I didn't lose a single pound. I don't know. Can you tell me about that? Let's see. I didn't have hunger, so I didn't eat and it didn't seem to affect my body at all. How easy is it for you to get a good sleep? Well, I seem to have developed some horrible neck pain, and that's made things doubly difficult. The second thing is that I, because I'm always plagued by these horrible nightmares, they're actually just actual events that have actually happened to me, just replaying over and over. I am an internet addict, and I just put stuff on YouTube or whatever on all night long, and, you know, I frequently have loud, loud sounds, so I don't sleep that well. And I have a horrible, horrible bed at the moment. I live in a very noisy place. Why do I live in a noisy place? Because I have been unemployed, as I told, or underemployed, as I told you, and I don't have money to live in a place that should be the equal of all the hard work I've done in my life. What are you looking at? I don't know, just tired. Yes, a couple people that I've met with have told me that I had it. The first time? I don't know. Maybe 15. The recurring nightmares, the, I don't know. I developed anxiety and I freak out, you know, if I think I'm going to run out of gas, I get short of breath and I don't know. I used to be able to handle anything. Now something stupid happens and I catastrophize it and think that it's going to be horrific. So I have to talk myself out of it. Oh, I've lost all the ability to trust and I'm numb to all feelings. Pardon me? Oh, well, I don't know what you said. Can you tell me about that? Well, you know, I think my PTSD, I was fine and I had it. After the 18-year-old incident, I did fine and dandy. And then something happened in the last, like, decade. I just had hit after hit after hit. And it just brought everything back up. Or maybe it's because I'm not that busy anymore, so I have time to ruminate over all these horrible things. And I've, it's a delayed thing. I'm way worse now than I was after the, you know, escaping from a serial killer. I mean, it's kind of, kind of a pain in the neck. Oh, literally. if I'm not being healthy I will you know drink a couple things of alcohol which I don't I don't know something's wrong with my heart they told me and so anymore you know even if I have just one causes a lot of pain and stuff um or I try to do stuff to relax or, you know, if I'm having a really, really bad day, I might hit myself or hurt myself in some other way. Because after you do that, it releases all, you know, you're all freaked out and then if you hurt yourself, you get really distracted like, oh, you know, this really hurts. And then you don't really think about the horrible thing that was in your head anymore. You're thinking about, I've got this pain. What got you? Are you still very happy now? have the money and nobody cares about you know lower middle income class people you know I've been to a gajillion there I'm not a gazillion but you know I don't know 15 therapists maybe over my 30 years or whatever it has been sometimes you get somebody that's good and I found that the younger the person the better better actually like a couple when I was in law school I went to see someone or when my father died when I was 18 um right at the same time that other thing happened I saw some students they were actually the best ones the worst ones seem to be the ones that are like in my age category or older because they've kind of checked out and they just want somebody who's there but in terms of like I don't know I did that EMD whatever thing it was called once and didn't really didn't really work And sometimes you get a nougat. Like once some therapist said to me, you don't want to kill yourself. You just want a different life. So when I am suicidal, I just think of that sentence. I don't want to kill myself. I just want a different life. So sometimes you get a nougat, but, you know, generally it hasn't really saved me yet. Tell me more about that. Do I have to? I just did. sometimes you get a good therapist oh one thing I learned is that most therapists are actually more screwed up than me you know I may seem screwed up to you guys here but you know at least I used to be able to function I was somewhat successful and I I've never intentionally hurt people I don't screw people over I'm not dishonest in my work I'm compassionate and I've found so many therapists you know they live their little teeny lives in suburbia or wherever the heck they're from and they're totally incapable of relating to anything that's outside of their world well i haven't been as i told you so um when i did go i noticed that it was fun to go somewhere once a week and have somebody listen to your tales of woe although sometimes it got frustrating if the person was not helpful really happy um i've been trying to cultivate it so last night i was on the bike path and i looked around at the beautiful naturey things and there were briefs literally seconds where i had it and then, you know, some aggressive bike rider or somebody else would come along, and that would be destroyed. But otherwise, more than perhaps a brief second or a couple of seconds. I don't even know. I don't even know. Oh, it is good? Oh, my God, are you even listening? I don't think you're listening very carefully. You're like some of the shrinks I've had. people, is that what you wanted me to tell you about? I I don't even know what the question was anymore to tell you the truth sorry Or no, is this the empty silence that I'm supposed to be filling to answer for you? What was the question? I don't know. Sometimes therapy is helpful, sometimes it's not. Oh, the happiness, that was the question. I've had happy my happiest moment was when I climbed up inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that was extremely I don't know it's just a wonderful wonderful feeling I'm claustrophobic so I was proud that I made it through there and it was just an amazing sight Gosh, is this a test to see how one reacts when there's an uncomfortable silence? Am I supposed to be pushing the button for the person to come in now? Hello there. I'm going to get an air message for a student. Alright. She did stop talking. I don't know why. I'll just shut it down. I thought it was a test of how one reacts to reading. I thought it was a test of how one reacts during an uncomfortable silence. I don't think that's what I'm wearing. I don't think it's just enough for me.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/636_P/636_AUDIO.wav,2
637,49,2," Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. I think I got it. Okay. Okay, like that. Okay. Okay. I'm going to start the recording. She's just going to ask you three of the questions. And then, once in a while, she should say goodbye. But it's for any reason she's not. We're going to have 15 seconds of a minute of our own, and you can continue. If not, we're just going to sit down. And right now, if she can't answer, then she can hold it. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm 15 years old. I'm a student at the University of Michigan. I'm a student at the University of Michigan. I'm not a student. I'm a student at the University of Michigan. I'm a student at the University of Michigan. I have a question. In San Francisco, there's a town called San Francisco, and it's called San Francisco. Is it a city, too? Yes. Okay. So, how do you do that? Fine. Okay. Where are you from and where are you from? San Francisco. What are some things you do in the area that you like to do? What are some things you like to do? It's terrible not having a car. That's the hardest part. You can't really do L.A. without a car in every way. By bus, I do. My most memorable experiences. What did you study at school? What are you doing now? That's how to live with joy. That's when your life flows, is when you do more of what brings you joy. That's my current dilemma. What's your dream job? I think my dream job would be weighing 70 pounds less and being a really emotionally diverse actress. So I could play comedy roles, which is easier for me, and heavy drama roles, which is more of a challenge to be vulnerable and to open up emotionally. So that's kind of what I'm studying right now. And I would look a thousand percent better because my hair would be long. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I really am thinking I don't have a family anymore. My father passed away and there's no relationship with my sister and a very poor one with my mother. So it's almost like not having any family anymore. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen and think, Hey, I know it's not bloody, but it's the best I've got. What do you do in your life? How are you at the moment? Pretty good. I guess it was a couple months ago, and it was a friend that kind of flipped out on me. That would be the situation. I wish I did handle it differently. What symptom is the embarrassment? Infidelity. Tell me about some hardest decisions you've ever had. That's a good question. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. Well, I had an amazing cat. And if you can imagine, it was more than a cat. It was like a being, a very large entity in the body of a cat. And my cat passed away. and I had to, I wanted to have a proper burial at an animal cemetery and have a memorial service for my cat and my mother was against these ideas. That was too much for a cat and so it took me two and a half months to come up with the money to find his casket and to decide on what style of casket I wanted because it was so hard to own that decision when I didn't get any support over it but eventually I triumphed and I found an artisan in Tennessee that makes cedar chests and he made me the most beautiful cedar casket octagonal octagonal with ivory lining and plush padding on the inside of the casket and the people at the animal cemetery said that in 20 years of business they'd never seen such a beautiful casket and they'd never seen someone that gave so much to their animal. So I felt really, really good when I saw the way that I was sort of like sending my cat you know, into the cemetery. Oh, an event I could erase from my memory. Um, I think I have erased a lot of events from my memory. Um, well, I've probably had a lot of them. Weird experiences. definitely no well you know I'm a very determined human being so I work myself into being in positive states of mind but overall I think that I'm definitely realizing I have some, um, deep, uh, depression. Um, and essentially I just need more of a support network here in LA. Um, I need to create a new family and, um, that's basically what I need to, you know, really do, which is difficult because, um, it's hard to have a family and, um, family and friends, you know, people that you can really, really trust. And it's just hard to get around L.A. without a car. So I feel a lack of support in my life, and I feel isolated and lonely. Other than that, I'm very optimistic. Any changes? yeah I walk to work which is in Beverly Hills and I walk through Beverly Hills and I noticed that even though I'm walking around nice places I'm joyless when I'm walking to work it doesn't really make me that happy it makes me happier when I get to the commercial part and there's more people around and there's lots of kind of like activity and shops It does nothing for me like walking through the neighborhoods, I noticed. I noticed that I have a lot of lethargy in my body, which is depression. I'm really working hard at going to sleep before midnight, and I noticed that it makes a big difference when I do get enough sleep. I'm fine, I'm just tired, but I think I'm pretty fine energy wise in terms of interacting with other people. PTSD, no. Yes. Yes. Recently. Recently. Lethargy, lack of joy, lack of community, lack of close bonds, lack of support network no one to talk to not a lot of energy to do extra things that would help make your life better it's just sort of get into the struggle of just getting through the day and then trying to find the energy to do something to make it better. Yeah, I think I know what my overall trigger, what the overall thing is, but it's deeper than the overall thing itself. If that makes any sense. Well, I um you guys are going to think I'm a complete whack job but honestly I'm really not I um I called my mother yesterday and I left her a message and at the end of the message I said I love you um and uh that's a month since she called me which was my birthday when she called me I didn't answer but she didn't say she loved me the year before that she didn't even call me on my birthday and she said she wasn't feeling well and we had a falling out in November so I haven't spoken to her since the following out but essentially what I realized in November was just a tremendous amount of inability to love that she has towards me and I think it's a lifelong thing so I think it's hard for me to get close to people and to bond with people because if you can't trust your mother who can you trust and if you haven't received love from your mother and you don't know really how to receive love actually something about receiving love or receiving self-worth or validation or something like that I think that lack of support, you know, throughout my whole life, regardless of how ambitious or determined I am, that there's an underpinning really every day, you know, of sadness about that, not having a mother. And so that's, I think, the main challenge to work out in my psyche or soul or emotions, something like that how do I cope with my emotions well I sit with them alone mainly since there's no one to share the deeper ones with that would really understand me there's no long-term relationships. But I do interact with my emotions a lot when I'm training my instrument in acting class. And so that's a big, you know, workout emotionally. What part of your life did you miss? A couple months ago I went through a patch where I didn't have a place to stay and ended up staying with someone that I thought was a student friend. She turned out to be crazy and I had to leave there and as a result I had to seek counseling per the mandate of my school. That's the incident that triggered it. Yes. is useful? It's a reflective experience, so you're reflective throughout the week before you see your therapist and then you sort of start thinking on a deeper level about a theme, a current theme that's like what's really the issue and then it feels very look forward to having someone to talk to that can really listen so the gift of active listening and then feeling a satisfaction from another human being caring about you your welfare and having someone to talk to on a deeper level. When I was in my acting class, which was, well, I took some classes, I audited some classes last week, and at those moments, a lot of joy, and when I was at my school studying, which was like two and a half months ago. Who's been a positive influence in my life? That would be... The most positive influence was my cat, Benjamin, and my former partner, Lance. And... No best friends at the moment. How do you know something is important to you? What are you most proud of in your life? And I'm most proud of that I have been making a lot of progress, you know, working on career stuff. And I have a positive attitude, even though it's very difficult growing up with a family that doesn't give you the kind of emotional or financial support. So I've grown up with a lot of jealousy and negativity and lack of support. You're welcome. Goodbye. Hi. I don't know if you can remember her name. Back to the . I'll take you there in a second.

I'd like to know about one of your trips. I went to Spain recently and that's a little bit of a more laid back lifestyle. They don't work the same amount of hours as Americans, different culture. culture they take a lot of breaks, rests during the middle of the day, especially in the summer when it's really hot. Totally different food style, culture. They go out to bars and restaurants a lot later, stays open later and you know it's just something new is exciting and you know I look forward to seeing other types of destinations like that. Going to Spain with all my old high school friends. I hadn't seen them in a while. And we did a big tour of Spain. We went to Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia. Had a great time.

Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtip screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Yeah. What do you do to relax? Usually I'll just watch a movie or go to the movies, go to the park. I have a small dog so I like taking him around the block. So that usually relaxes me a bit.

I keep a lot of my emotions inside, which isn't always good, but I never have crazy angry outbursts and get violent or anything like that. like that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with someone was a few weeks ago. We were actually in Las Vegas and we were with a big group of people and we were just trying to decide where to go and one of my friends was pretty adamant about one place and it was unappealing to the rest of the group. So, you know, it got a little confrontational, but everything worked out in the end. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I think the passing of my mom's dad. I wish I would have been a little more loving and emotional to my mom about it. You know, it was a very difficult time for her. and I should have been there a little bit more than I was. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about just not being as loving and caring to my parents.

Tell me more about that. Well, you know, whenever you lose someone close to you in a family, you know, it's very difficult for everyone. And, you know, different people show their emotions differently. So, you know, for me, I tend to keep a lot of it in. And, you know, it would be a little more beneficial if I was able to express it to someone more. But, you know, I don't really feel comfortable doing that all the time. So hopefully things get better. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's very difficult because I work a lot of strange hours too. So I'm up, you know, working late and then got to get up early. And sometimes I can sleep in more. So, you know, if I'm not in a set routine, it makes it a little more difficult.

Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something that I recently did that I enjoyed was completing a big project for someone. I built a large website that had been a big project for a while and it's been taking up a lot of my time. So finally getting that finished and taken care of was a big relief and a weight off my shoulders. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of my family. They've always been there for me. I've gone through a lot of tough times when I was younger and they've always been there to support me and that's really meant a lot. So that's really kept me going.

650,24,1," Now I'm going to start up our recording. Hi, I'm Ellen. Okay. Okay. Absolutely, yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. Where are you from originally? I was born and raised in New York City. What are some things you really like about LA? The city life and the fast pace. What are some things you don't really like about the world? Cost of living is pretty expensive. Have you traveled a lot? Not recently. I traveled mostly while I was in the military. Why? What's one of your most memorable experiences? What did you study at school? Academics, foreign languages. What do you do now? Private security. Okay. What's your dream job? Probably in the same industry, private security, that would be high paying. Or something along the lines of mental health or something like what we're doing right now. As long as it helps provide for the family and pay the bills. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More outgoing than shy. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I'm... Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best-aid guide. What do you do to relax? Uh, I watch TV and spend time with my family. How are you at controlling your income? Very good, actually. Very, very controlled. I have to in my field. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? It was with my wife and it was about finances. Yes. That's a good question. I believe... Coming to California and leaving my oldest daughters in Florida. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Leaving the military. It was for finances, and I knew I had to go. So in 1997, I made the choice, and all I had known was the military. So that was pretty hard. Tell me about NIDA or something that you were sure was going to happen. Probably some of my past. Before the military, I was in a relationship, not a girlfriend-boyfriend relationship. I was basically victimized by my mother. I wish I could erase that, but in a way it kind of makes me who I am. Have you ever served in the military? Yes, almost nine years, U.S. Air Force. How old were you when you joined the military? Eighteen years old. How did you decide to join the military? had no other choice it was either go in the military or stay out on the streets in New York City I had no money for college and no chance at getting a good job so I enlisted yes absolutely probably the best choice in in fixing my life growing up that I ever made. Three separate times, yes. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? I had some growing pains at first. It was a little bit difficult in the beginning, but I adjusted. What did you do after you were in the military? security and then law enforcement it gave me a sense of sense of regimentation it gave me structure that I wouldn't have otherwise gotten and I believe as far as within people in just the general population, it does set you aside. It sets you apart. How have you been doing lately? All right, I guess. In a bit of a struggle sometimes. Can you tell me about that? Just seeking employment, and it's very difficult, especially with the way things are. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. Just trying to land that dream job, as you said before. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good next week? Pretty easy, especially if I've been active throughout the day. That's usually every day. What are you like when you get sleep well? Tired, first of all. And can't concentrate well. yes I have long time ago my goodness 1990 1992 yeah 1992 what were your symptoms? cold sweats nightmares night terrors disorientation waking up not knowing where I am, things of that sort. Are you triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. It was mostly following one of my combat experiences in South America. Tell me more about that. I went to Columbia on President Bush's war on drugs. We had to live in the jungle and while in the jungle we also had to take a couple of lives while we were there. So that was one of the three instances that I saw combat action. How do you cope with them? I learned a long time ago that you have to put your past behind you. So I just do. I had to put it behind me. it was not easy, but it was the right thing to do, and it was so that others may live. So it may not have felt right at the time, but it was the right thing to do. Okay. What got you into the army? In the military, when you have a combat-related experience, you always go through a debrief. At the debrief, you are asked if you need help coping with the situation. So, of course, I immediately raised my hand and told them I need help with coping with the situation. It took roughly about, I want to say somewhere around three weeks to a month of seeing a therapist. And once they gave me some key exercises to do, the acuteness of the night terrors and the nightmares went away. It was at first, and very seldom am I bothered by it now, because it was so long ago. Are you still going to do it for now? No, absolutely not. Why did you stop? I didn't need it anymore. I learned enough coping skills that were good enough to be able to cast that aside and not depend upon any facet of treatment or anything else. Do you feel therapy is a sport? Yes, I do feel it is. Throwing medication at that kind of problem sometimes is necessary, but in my case I don't feel it is, and I will not be dependent upon medications. But the therapy, 100%, I agree. Especially speaking to somebody one-on-one, it does help. Can you tell me about that? What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? How long? really happy about three weeks ago it was on payday I didn't have very many positive role models, very few, especially in my childhood. I had a lot of negative examples on what not to be. So positive role models, I'd probably say most of my superiors in the military, that was my biggest growth experience in my life. How do your best friends guide you? Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. daughter do some martial arts at her school. I really enjoy that all the time. My daughters, my three daughters.

We all speak on a weekly basis. I come from a large family, I have a lot of brothers and sisters. My mother and father are still living so I talk to them.

My demeanor sometimes tells people otherwise, but I'm a really calm person. People say that I look mean, but I'm not. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?

That really bothers me when someone is being mistreated and I don't even really know, couldn't really pointed out but I know that's probably what it was about. The first thing that comes to mind is when my marriage broke up. I wish I would have just accepted it a lot sooner than I did and moved on with my life. I had been married for over twenty years and I was hard for me to accept the fact that my wife wanted a divorce, and I tried to hang in a lot longer and just got myself used and abused. So I wish I would have just grasped that situation and moved on a lot faster. What's something you feel guilty about? That when my wife and I took in our granddaughters and I promised to raise them and see them through their upbringing that I didn't have the opportunity to do that. Not that it was my fault and I feel guilty about that. that. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, that goes back to acceptance of accepting the end of my marriage. That was the hardest decision was when I finally just decided that to stop fighting the what was going to happen and move forward all right tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory hmm i wouldn't i'd say that i probably wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory because i've I've grown and learned from every experience I've ever had in my life. So I wouldn't say that I want to erase anything. Those are the things that make me who I am today. And I like me today. Have you ever served in the military? Yes, I have. I'm a veteran of the United States Army. How old were you when you joined the military? I was 19 years old. Why did you decide to join the military? Well, initially, the idea of having college money, which I was very motivated to go to college, having that money to fund my college education was very appetizing. and also I felt like I needed a break from academics but I knew I wanted to start up again at some point. But that didn't happen, you know, life happened, I got married and da da da da da. So I'm still trying to complete a college education now at age 47. So almost 30 years have gone by but I'll get it. Are you happy you did that? Yes, this is the best experience, the best thing I've ever done for myself was joining the Army. I'm still paying dividends. It's my living today. It helps me pay my bills today, my pension that I receive. Taught me a lot. I got to learn, got to meet people from all over the country, see places that I'd never seen before. Gave me a lot of opportunities. Did you ever see combat? No, I did not. I'm sorry. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It's a bit of a struggle. You know, when you're serving your country, you get used to being regimented and having a place to be every day and then all of a sudden you're free basically and and you don't don't have that that discipline in your life anymore so it's hard to to readjust I think it took me a long time longer than I realized What did you do after the military? All right. How did serving in the military change you? It gave me a lot of self-confidence. I was never very athletically inclined, but that's the most physical activity I'd ever had. I developed my body, developed my mind, showed how much mental fortitude that I had. Got me over a lot of things. Showed me a lot of strength about myself. That's great. How have you been feeling lately? Lately I've been feeling pretty good. It's been going pretty well. I've been a lot more active than I had been. I'm searching for an apartment right now and moving out of my current living situation. very exciting. I've just been more active in my daily life. Just along the same lines, I seem to be a little bit happier. The depression visit there. So, overwhelmingly, I still have some bad days, but I take my medication and I go to my counseling and everything seems to be working out pretty well. I'm sorry to hear that. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's very difficult. I toss and turn, have night sweats, probably have nightmares that I don't recall. I wake up several times. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Actually, I'm a lot more, I'm overly energetic. Adrenaline takes over and I zip through my day and then at the end of the day I'm exhausted. and that makes it harder to sleep again, so it's just a continuous vicious cycle. So I don't know what to do about it. I talk to my doctors, and they don't want to put me on too much sleep medication, so I just try to get a good night's sleep and just take as much rest as I can. Try not to nap during the day, hopefully having a better sleep during the night. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? It's been over 10 years ago, probably longer than that. I don't remember the exact date. What were your symptoms? Anger, nightmares, restlessness. I don't recall everything that they said because I have a lot of overlapping problems. So, you know, anxiety. Are you triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. Tell me more about that. Well, I really don't know what to say. I guess I'd have to get a... How do you cope with them? I talk about it. When I'm feeling down, I talk to people. I get out and I do things. I help somebody else get out of self and be of service to others. If I get it out of self, then it is quite helpful. That's good. What got you to seek help? Well, what brought me, what got me to seek the help is I'm an alcoholic and I was drinking. and I wanted to quit drinking and then I had to discover the reasons that I was drinking and I was drinking alcohol as self-medication for different problems and I had to get away from the alcohol and other substances, other drugs and once I did that I was able to, I had professionals who were more able to differentiate with the alcoholic problems from the other problems and and prescribe the right medications prescribe the right the type right try a type of treatment you know group therapy individual therapy those things have been quite helpful All day. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes I do. Yes I do. I have group therapy five days a week and individual therapy once a week. Okay. Do you feel therapy is useful? Very much so. As a catharsis, I'm able to take my old heavy luggage and leave it somewhere and not carry it around. It's like I have this big balloon over my head that's filled with all my negative thinking, my negative situations, my negative thoughts, everything. and every time I'm in therapy or I'm in an AA meeting or a CA meeting, I get to empty that balloon out and not have to carry around such a burden. I get to leave that luggage, that garbage, somewhere else and not have to carry it around and have it be a burden on myself. So that's quite helpful. Can you tell me about that? It's just an excellent way of getting rid of bad feelings. What changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? I'm not as depressed. I'm a lot more outgoing. I still have a long way to go. My feelings of unworthiness are limited. They still are there. But I do feel better about myself. I like myself better today than I did say two years ago. So there's hope. When was the last time you felt really happy? That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? First of all, my father. He's a good man. My mother. My older brothers. They're excellent. I don't really know that I have a best friend. I know I have some friends. I went to a baseball game. I had a game on a Sunday and went to the California Angels, played the Oakland A's, went out to a baseball game with a sober group and went out and ate hot dogs and nachos and drank Pepsi and enjoyed a nice Sunday afternoon baseball game. That was really a good time. What are you most proud of in your life? I'd say my granddaughters. I don't have any biological children, but I have a stepdaughter and then her kids and they all call me. So even though my wife and I aren't together, I'm still an active part of their lives, and I'm very proud of them. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay, thank you. Goodbye. Thank you. Give me one second. you you you you you you Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/659_P/659_AUDIO.wav,1

Well, when I did travel, I was, it was just to go somewhere else and be with a certain group of people, doing workshops and stuff. and stuff. But now I don't like to, I wouldn't want to fly anymore because of all the restrictions and problems they've had since 9-11. How did you get into the military? Well, I flew out to, well I used to fly a lot out to San Francisco area and I was with group of people reclaiming we did a ritual workshops and I spent some time going a lot of workshops we were outside so I kind of like we'd have a week of camping out and having little workshops and getting to know people from different parts of the country find out what's going on Finding out I had breast cancer, stage three. That was a memorial. That one really, you know. I had 11 surgeries, kinds of tumors. Breast cancers have come back, but I've had tumors. I've had 11 surgeries because of tumors. Tumors on my ovary, tumor on my kidney. Maybe I had a, something on my thyroid they had to take out. So it's been an experience. That's great. What did you study at school?

Well, I'd like to be a crime scene investigator. That would be it, if I had to choose. Yeah, I'm somewhat shy. If I'm working or something, I'm not. Because I know what I've got to do and I know how to communicate. But just on a personal level with people, I am. Fear of intimacy, I guess. PTSD and mastectomy. It's strange. My dad's in there. Um, I play video games. I get on the computer and play some games and it, I get focused on that and it's relaxing for me and it takes my mind off stuff. How long do you have to stay in the hospital? Uh, I try not to, well I saw a therapist for six years dealing with anger issues after I'm a Vietnam veteran. I'm on psych meds, so I guess that controls it. When is the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? A friend of mine wants to come over, and she's scheduled to come over Wednesday, tomorrow, and somebody else came up with something they wanted her to do and she just felt like she could call me and cancel with me and go out with her friend and I told her, I said, it's not going to work. You have to stick with it. You made an appointment with me first, so you're going to have to deal with that. I got kind of frustrated because she just felt like she could call and make plans and cancel any time. and I don't like it. How did you get into a situation where you were seeing a different person? Probably the way I handled the breast, when I found out I had breast cancer stage 3, I would have gotten a support group right away. I didn't see a social worker right away. I was running a prosthetic lab, and I was more worried about that than my breast cancer. I think I would have done that different. What's something you feel closer about? Well, then I did try to be more involved with my sister's lives and stay closer to home, up to Pacific Northwest. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Tell me about Mabuse or something that you would choose for this community. All the years of drinking. Alcoholic for a long time. But I was self-medicating, so I wish I could have not done that.

No, during the Vietnam era women weren't allowed to go to combat. Learning to fire the M16 was optional. I was in communications, which was, I had Crider Top Security clearance. How do you feel about the fact that you're going to be a nurse? Well, I look back now, I can see where some of the, I started drinking and I was acting goofy and I can see back it was the PTSD and the trauma and stuff. I never saw it that way then, but I can look back now and see why some things happened. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. What did you do after you moved here? Well, the first thing I did was get a job as a bartender, mix with people. Then I went to work for an insurance company for about four years. I took some college, business college classes. I worked for a long time outside Chicago for a long time. And then I ended up working 16 years in prosthetics and orthotics. But I didn't drink for 15 years. I didn't smoke cigarettes for 10 years. And then I found out I have breast cancer stage 3, so I kind of changed my plans. How does getting in a location feel? I get panic attacks and it's like I get startled easily. Like on the time I was on a bus and fell asleep and something startled me and the bus driver knew right away he said you're a veteran aren't you I mean just the way I was acting he knew so it changed me and I started numbing a little depressed a little depressed I don't know high holidays are coming up this is a month of aloo starting tonight and it's time for introspection so I look at the past year what I've done is I just I don't think I've done that much you know. Have you noticed any changes in your delivery and vaccination? I'm a little more depressed I'm taking medications for it but I guess I just gotta wait it out I don't know. Can you tell me about that? A couple people I know died, and a friend of mine moved out. It's been depressing to see that happen. Three people I know died in the last three or four months, so it's been a little depressing there. But I don't know. How easy is it for you to get a good next week? It's not too easy. Well, probably irritable and I don't really want to be around people. I get restless. Sometimes I can be tired and can't sleep. So I try, I'll play a computer game. It's my only answer to getting my mind off stuff. Yes. I got it. How long ago were you going to get a computer game? What was it called? Being startled easily. I don't like people standing too close to me. I have social anxiety now. I don't like to be around a lot of people. Like going to the, like if they had a jazz festival or something, I wouldn't want to be there because of all those people. I'm isolated more. How do you focus then? I don't know. I just try to play computer games. I sleep. It's hard for me to focus. Can you tell me about that? Well, not really. I can't explain it myself. What got you into this? Well, I'm a veteran in the Substance Abuse Treatment Center at the VA. A veterans rep caught me. and told me about the VA. So I went up there, and I figured it was my last resort, really, because I was lost for what to do. Finally reached that point. So, yeah. I go to group therapy once a week.

Well, if it gets any better, I'm going to have to take the straps off and shoot straight up. Where are you from originally? I'm a native Californian. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I enjoy life itself so it doesn't matter if I'm in LA but some of the things Hollywood, you know, some of the tourist attractions, you know, some of the exciting events, amusement parks, things of that nature. What are some things you don't really like about your life? Well, I don't like the gangs, the violence, those type of, you know, behaviors associated with life, but it is what it is. It's part of the structure in the city. So, you know, hopefully we can get a handle on that. I see you travel a lot. No, not today. I used to travel a lot, but I'm kind of mellowed out today. Why? Well, job. So I've been off work for a little while. I'm self-employed and it's primarily building my home-based business in Long Beach. So that kind of restricts my movement at this point in time. But that's soon to change in the next couple of months I believe. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Well that would have to be female oriented. No. I don't know, sports or something like that. I have a lot. What do you study at school? Well public relations and plant processing, primarily fire and safety, health and safety. Well right now I do insurance, legal insurance and some industrial safety as a consultant. What's your dream job? Well, it would have to be, it would be traveling all over the world. That would be something where I can interact with various cultures and, you know, get to know their traditions and how they live and you know just experience other people's you know lifestyles living skills and whatnot well it depends on the circumstances you know I I believe God you know gave us two ears and one mouth, one, you know, mouth to talk at appropriate times, and two ears to listen more so you can understand what's going on and how to respond. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Oh, it's all good. You know, I stay interactive with my sons, daughters, sisters, And I enjoy it. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Right, right, right. What do you do to relax? Well, primarily I play sports and, you know, I stay active. I watch a movie or go to movies or go to dinner. You know, I, or read a book. Well, I think I'm a pretty cool, calm, collected type guy. You know, there are, I am human. I do have feelings, and, you know, I try to control those and respond. Not react, but respond appropriately and, you know, kind of analyze, you know, my feelings, emotions, and the origin of how I'm feeling when I'm discomforted. When I'm cool, when I'm in the flow, I'm just, you know, in alignment with my greatest source of strength and courage, you know, the divine order of things for me. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? Well, I try to nip arguments in the butt before they get too out of hand or misconstrued or misinterpreted. So I don't really argue. If I see it coming on, I take a timeout, remove myself from the discomfort, and come back and address it later. You know, when there's a decline in the overall anxiety, frustration, whatever. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had known differently. Well, you know, there are several. you know or coming up through life but in retrospect I'd have to say anytime there was a physical confrontation I think I could have handled that more appropriately more healthy if you will yeah but that's neither here nor there What's something you feel guilty about? where can I become better and so no one's perfect but you know I strive to become better a better man a better you know friend a better husband or better whatever you know overall and so for me they're just challenges and I have to recognize them as such and you know correct errors of the past and set new disciplines into my future and it works for me it's been working for me since I acknowledged that and applied healthier solutions if you will Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Oh. That's a good one. The hardest decision I would ever have to make. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Well in actuality I don't have any events like that because it is what it is. You know the past can be a thief if you live in the past. The future is unknown, so I live towards today. You know, they say the present, you know, is a gift. Life itself is a gift on a daily basis, and that's why they call it the present. So I try to stay in the present. I do, you know, acknowledge the past and mistakes and, you know, achievements as well. and overall percentage wise I'm winning so it's learning experiences I've accumulated in my journey and as I proceed forward I tend to go more upward okay yes How old were you when you joined the military? I was 20 years old. How did you decide to join the military? Well, I knew I was headed for trouble in actuality. I realized the path I was on wouldn't lead to, and, you know, financial struggles at that time. So, military was an option. I could get an education and pursue, see some of the world. And, you know, there were multiple benefits available, and I think that's what prompted me to endeavor there. Are you happy with your start? Yes, in actuality I am. Did you ever see combat? No, I was a peacetime guy. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? The transition was relatively easy because I came out and I got a job with the VA within a couple of months. And so it made my transition a little more smoother and whatnot. I'm sorry. What are you sorry about? What did you do after the military? Well, after the military I got employed and, you know, involved myself in several careers or jobs and lived life. And, you know, experienced the highs, the lows, the in-betweens, and just lived. continued on the journey of life. That's great. I think it is, yeah. I'm sorry. Could you repeat that? How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling great. Tell me more about that. Well overall I'm happy with my life, my overall achievements, where I'm headed, what I look forward to, and my overall lifestyle. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I say, you know, random changes as far as perceptions and other opportunities available. So, you know, nothing irregular. It's normal, what would you say, experience in life within the city, you know, and inner circle and whatnot. Tell me more about that. About which one? How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Well, that's pretty good. I kind of exhaust myself. I'm up early in the morning. By 11 o'clock, I'm trying to get to sleep, which I read a little bit or watch a movie or whatever, and I just fall right off to sleep. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, when I don't sleep well, I would be tired. My body would tell me, hey, you didn't get enough sleep. Pay attention to that because that's essential to your performance and whatnot. I'm aware of that. I may be kind of tired, but I live through it. I get a, I make the most of it. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really, really, really happy? I guess when I was in love, I don't know. That's about, yeah. But I'm happy today. I mean, really excitingly happy would be when I recognize, you know, the virtue of love. That's great. I agree. Okay. Well, you know, my sisters, my daughters, my sons, some of my, you know, close friends that I interact with, um, they're, you know, uh, what would you say, contributing to the development of life and what it stands for, what it really means. They understand that and they participate in it in a healthy, meaningful way. And, and, uh, those are some of the influences that, you know, the center, my center of influence that, you know, I kind of, it kind of inspired me. How would your best friend describe you? Great guy. Magnificent, amazing, phenomenal guy, respectively. I'm another man amongst my fellow men, but I'm an asset to life and what it stands for, I believe. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I took my daughter's skating and then took them to dinner afterwards. We had a good time. I don't know.

Well, I was born in Oklahoma and raised here in Los Angeles, South Bay District area, Gardena, Torrance, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach, Long Beach. All right. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, like I said, I grew up here as a child. I like the people for the most part. What do you really like about LA? The smog. Too much traffic. Sometimes you feel like you're in a maze because LA just keeps growing and growing and growing and the space is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. Other than that though, I don't have any problems with Los Angeles. I like to fish, I'm right here by the coast, so that's never a problem. I see what you mean. That's my way of relieving stress, I like to go fishing. Do you travel a lot? No I'm pretty much a home buddy, I pretty much stay in the area. I used to travel a lot. But since I've gotten older, I've become more of a, I wouldn't say couch potato, but I like to stick close to home. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting people. Seeing things. Finding new places, new restaurants, new museums. Just meeting people. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. Well, I used to, when I'd get a three-day weekend when I was younger, I would just jump in my car, throw my fishing tackle in the trunk, and just take off. I'd either go from here to San Diego, from here to Oregon or whatever on a three-day weekend. I wouldn't tell anybody where I was. I'd come back, and everybody would be freaked out. We've been trying to get a hold of you. Where are you? But I used to do it just to get away from everything, the stress at work or whatever, or school for that matter. but I used to meet a lot of interesting people a trip I took to San Diego one time and I stayed at what's the island over there where the Navy SEALs train there's a big hotel over there and it was in the middle of the week and it was like I was the only one there It was nice. I could take a nap if I wanted, read a book, just walk along the beach. It was really pleasant. What did you study at school? Quality engineering, mechanical engineering. I have an associate's degree of science degree from... And then I have my bachelor's degree from... in quality engineering with my aerospace certificate. it. I've been in quality assurance for like 35 years for in aerospace. What do you do now? The same thing, quality manager for an aerospace machine shop here in Harbors. I'm qualified as both quality manager and quality engineering so I pretty much handle both. my dream job being retired and be able to go fishing every day just kidding actually i am in my dream job i've always pictured myself having my own office being in charge of what it is i do I can go both ways on that sometimes I'm standoffish shy but for the most part I'm outgoing why? well I just the way I am I guess It goes along with... What's your relationship with your family? Oh, well, I have three children that are grown. One of them is a doctor. She's a biologist. She lives in Colorado. Two of them live in Arkansas. I'm divorced for so many years. I keep in contact with my kids. My parents are both deceased. My grandparents are deceased. My older sister just moved back So we've been keeping in contact. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fish Tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Oh, sure. What do you do to relax? Oh, I like to go fishing. I like to watch a good movie, an entertaining movie. A lot of the guys where I live, they like to watch, like, TruTV. cops, things like that, and I kind of stay away from that stuff because you face it every day out on the street or on the bus or driving wherever, or wherever you might go, anywhere now, but pretty much just relax. Being able to focus on something that will take your mind off other things that you might be having a problem with or might be stressing you out. That work, for instance. How are you at controlling your temper? society that seem to be going towards the out of control direction as opposed to the getting things under control and but no I'm pretty good at managing my anger and my how would you say my reaction reactions to different situations Tell me more about that. Oh, let me think. I can't really think of anything significant. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Okay. I'll give you an incident. What's something you feel guilty about? A couple weeks ago. Oh, being something I feel guilty about? I picked up my mother was spent the last four years of her life in a subacute care center here at the little company of Mary from diabetes and stroke and I used to pick my dad up every morning drop him off spend an hour or so with my mother and then go on to work and then after work I'd pick him up and come drop him off and then I'd go back well the night she passed away I picked him up and dropped him off and then I had to go home for a little while and I was gonna go back that night and I fell asleep on a couch the next thing I know it's like the hardest decision I have to think about that. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. That situation that I just explained about the night my mother passed away. I'd fallen asleep, and when I got back up that morning to go pick up my dad, he said, your mother passed away last night. What made it really difficult, her mental capabilities were completely there. her cognitive awareness, everything. She knew what was going on, but her body just gave out. And nobody... Yes, I was in the United States Coast Guard for six years. I spent four years at Coast Guard Air Rescue. And my last 18 months was right here in... on the Coast Guard... when it was here. I think it's in Florida now. It was actually a pretty good duty. I made rate really quick. I did spend a couple days in the brig here and there, but I got out with my full E-5 status. That's one of the big, that's really the only true regret I have is I should have stayed in and been retired by now. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. How did you decide to join the military? Well, my grandfather pulled some strings and got me an appointment for Naval Academy. But my physical exam worse me out of that, my exam, because of bad depth perception. And they kind of wanted me to come in just as a general duty officer, but I wanted to be a pilot. I said, no, no, no, no. And I backed out of the whole thing. and then a year later I thought about it and go, well, I could still get drafted, so I went straight down and enlisted in the Coast Guard. Are you happy you did that? Oh, yes, it was definitely a better choice. It put me through my school, my education in the latter years. It taught me quite a bit of discipline. a lot of self-esteem. Did you ever see combat? Not as such. We arrested a few people on drug busts and that type of thing back in the 70s. But not combat per se, not armed combat. Most of it... How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Oh, it was great because the last, like I said, the last 18 months was right here in Los Angeles County. So it was basically a 9-to-5 job to me. So I had no problem going back into transition anyway. Over the six years that I was in the service, I saved a lot of money, U.S. savings bonds, of course. so I saved enough money to be able to relax for a couple of years to decide what I really wanted to do and that's when I decided to go back to college get a couple of degrees stay in manufacturing mechanical engineering quality engineering and I've been doing that 79. 79. It's been pretty productive. I pride myself in the knowledge and the experience I've picked up over the years. What did you do after the military? Machinist, machinist, engineering, quality control, quality assurance. That's great. How did serving in the military change you? Oh, it, quite a lot. It made me realize I had a future. Instead of just, when I was younger, you know, just kicking around, thinking you were going to live forever and not really focusing on anything for the future. But the military has been a very good benefit, especially the GI bills back then. Like I said, it paid for your education. So I had that option, and I took that option. I'm sorry to hear that. You're sorry to hear that, but I took the option to use the GI Bill for my education. How have you been feeling lately? A little tired here and there. I'm going through some side effects with my new inhalers. I have COPD bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, and they've been giving me some dizzy spells and coughing spells in the mornings when I get up and have to take these inhalers. And it really exhausts you. It takes a lot out of you. But I'm getting up there, and unfortunately I'm still smoking. But on the lighter side of that, I'm not smoking as much as I used to. But other than that, I'm doing pretty good. I'll be moving out of U.S. Vets in a couple of months, and I need to pick up with the pace on that to find an apartment. no i'm still focused at her work focused at getting into a permanent residence How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm sorry, why? things I could have handled better things I could have done a little differently tired little grouchy I guess a little grouchy but a cup of coffee and I'm usually through it over it No. No. Back before I got out of the service, I was diagnosed with, what do they call it, bipolarism. But I never really thought much about it. Because, you know, you get up and you get down. When was the last time you felt really happy? last Saturday when I went deep-sea fishing got a really nice red snapper that was about that big and went with went with friends it was a nice experience my grandfather my oh I used to spend a lot of time with him on summer vacations when I was a teenager. My dad was in his retired army so he was away so I guess my grandfather was more of my father's, the male figure in my life. He passed away 1972 no 1970 so you're one of 32 73 72 it was 1972 and I grew this friend easy going Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Fishing. Nice.

I was able back in 1986, I came into a significant amount of money to be able to put them all through college if they wanted. And my oldest daughter took me up on it. She graduated from college. She's doing her internship there as a doctorate in biology. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. you're very welcome I feel like I'm in a episode of The Matrix you need some pictures on that back goodbye You know, the first thing I thought of when I sat down and then I realized she was sitting there in that chair was the Matrix.

What are some things you really like about L.A.? Well... What are some things you don't really like about L.A.? I don't like... It's just too crowded in L.A. There's just too many people, and it's just everybody's rush-rush, and... I like a little more slow-paced. But I do like the weather here, so that's why I'm here, and my family is here. That's what brought me here. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? I traveled when I was younger, when I got out of the military because I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking to do with my life. But now I'm kind of settled in and going to school for culinary arts in Hollywood. and I have a fiancee who graduated from USC and I'm pretty happy with my life. But traveling not too much anymore, no. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting, going to new places, meeting new people, seeing other parts of the country. I haven't been to Europe but I hope to get there someday. That's basically about it. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. For quite a number of years I lived in New Orleans, Louisiana. I took a trip there and enjoyed the food. It was fantastic and the music was fantastic and the weather was great. And I loved it there. And then I took a trip, I've taken many trips to Las Vegas Because I used to be a gambler at one time, but not anymore. That's about it. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I'd rather not talk about that. What did you study at school? Well, I'm currently enrolled in a culinary arts school. But I got my GED in the military. And so now I'm taking up culinary arts to be a chef. I hope to open up a restaurant someday. What do you do now? I'm going to school. I'm going to school in and I work part time. That's it. Alright. What's your dream job? My dream job is to own a bed and breakfast with my fiance. That's my dream job. And I hope to make that come true within the next year or two. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Probably more shy than outgoing. I was very shy when I was growing up, but I'm still shy. But I'm trying to break out of my shell, so to speak. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, my mom and dad are no longer with us. They've passed on. And I have a sister in Northern California. And we were never close, so we don't communicate very much, which is probably partially my fault and partially her fault. We just don't seem to have a lot in common. So my mom passed away, and that was pretty rough. She was pretty sick. My dad passed away about nine years ago from Alzheimer's. So we had a good relationship, though. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? To relax I just like to go take walks, take a long walk on the beach, read a book, watch a little sports on TV. I love the outdoors so I love to get out and exercise whenever I can. That's what I do. Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? good very good very good I don't have a temper I don't get mad very it takes a lot for me to get very very mad at somebody I'm kind of easygoing guy no no not really you know I try to avoid trouble whenever I can sometimes you can't avoid it but I try. Yeah. I'm fine. Probably arguing with my roommate about making too much noise when he gets up in the morning and you know silly things like that. When you live in that kind of environment you have to learn to live with other people. It's kind of rough, but you do the best you can. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I don't really want to discuss that. I'd rather avoid that question. Alright. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably not getting enough education when I was younger and I had problems in school and running away from home and disappointing my family and things like that. I had a bad childhood due to my fault mostly not theirs but I made the wrong decisions which I'm paying for now but we have to move ahead the hardest decision I had to make was putting my mom to rest that was the hardest and it's been about two years now but I'm still not over that one so that was the hardest she was my best friend so now she's gone my early years before I went into the military I didn't have many friends I was very shy very bad in school. I wish I would have paid more attention. I'd probably be in a better position now but it's too late to worry about that now so we have to move on. And with the support and help of my fianc????????? that's what I'm doing. Have you ever served in the military? How old were you when you joined the military? I can't remember. It's been a long time. I was drafted. I didn't have a choice, really. I was drafted. So I went in the Army, which was a good experience, actually. Yes, I am. Yes, I am very happy, yeah. Yeah. And now I'm getting help from the military so that's a good thing. Yeah. Alright. Did you ever see combat? No. I was stateside all the time I was in the military. I was stationed in New Jersey, in Georgia, Texas. Most of my time was spent in Fort Hood, Texas. Yeah. Yeah. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It was well due to the fact that I didn't go overseas or see combat it wasu know it was hard leaving home at that young age but it was fairly easy. I didn't have much problem. I had some problems in the military, but, you know, I missed home a lot, missed my family, but it was okay. It was a good experience. I'm glad I did it. Okay. What did you do after the military? That's when I started traveling a lot because I didn't know. I was still young and I wanted to see the country and travel around work here work there get a job here get a job there instead I should have been going to school and while I was young and getting it having a decent job now instead of starting at the age of 60 but they say it's never too late so here I am I'll be okay I'll be all right That's great. Yeah. How did serving in the military change you? Well, it turned me into a man, that's for sure. Yeah. Yeah. It made me become more responsible and learn to be on my own. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? I have my good days and bad days because I'm on this new medication for depression so some days I don't feel good and I have other medical issues. I have breathing problems and I have some other medical issues but most of the time I feel pretty good but there are good days and bad days. I just take them one day at a time. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Well, I just know I don't sleep well. As a matter of fact, I hardly sleep at all, which is not good. And then, like I say, I have my depressing days and days where I just don't have any energy and don't feel like doing anything. I have my good days with my fiancee. Those are the best because she's my pride and joy. Without her, I don't know where I'd be. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very difficult. Very difficult. I average about three to four hours a night. Last night I woke up at about three o'clock in the morning and I never could go back to sleep. and that's not good. But yeah, my sleeping is very bad. It seems to get worse and worse every day. I'm sorry. Why? I'm not quite sure. I guess just I don't have the answer to that question. I don't know. Never used to be that way. I don't know. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, I have no energy and I get grouchy. I'm very restless, tired of course because I haven't slept. I do the best I can. That's it. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I'm not sure what that is. I don't know what that is. How long ago were you diagnosed? Well, I don't know what that is. I was never diagnosed with anything, but, you know, they wanted to put me on some sleeping pills. But I try and stay away from as much pills as I can. I really don't like to take a lot of medications. But there are some medications I have to take, Such as medications for my anxiety and my depression. Things like that. I have to have those. Other than that I'd rather stay away from medications if possible. What were your symptoms? Well I have anxiety attacks that I've had for the last three or four years which have put me in the hospital but as long as I stay on my medication I'm okay but I have stomach problems and just other issues. So it's just a day to day thing. I deal with it the best I can. I don't know. I'm not a, I really don't know. I just, I started this problems when I was losing my, I thought I was losing my eyesight because I had, my eye was popping out due to a thyroid problem I had and so they put me on this medication that I can't get off of now. I've been on it for about four years, five years. I'll probably be on it the rest of my life. I have to take it twice a day. Or I will end up in the emergency room, which I have before. But I'm okay. All right. How do you cope with them? I just try and deal with it the best I can. I'd go out and take a walk or engage in some physical activities, you know, go to the beach, like I said before, and things like that. Keep my mind occupied. That's the best way. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. What got you to seek help? Well, because I wasn't sure what was wrong with me and I was feeling sick every day, which is not natural. So I had to go see a psychiatrist, not because I'm crazy, just because I needed some help, some medication. And they gave me this medication that they didn't tell me that it was addictive. And it's highly addictive and I've been on it for, like I said, about four years now and I'll probably be on it the rest of my life so but it keeps me feeling okay yeah I can deal with things yeah okay well have an appointment tomorrow with a psychiatrist and yes I do not that often as long as I keep on my medication I'm okay yeah well the last time I was in therapy with the psychiatrist all they did was it wasn't very much of a help because they were talking to me about my family and things like that and they weren't really helping me any so I don't go to therapy that often you know I only go once a you know it's not a regular big thing I just go to see a psychiatrist and that was the first time I had gone and it's the whole session lasted about 10 minutes how's your family where they live blah blah blah blah blah and that's the end. Nothing about me or my problems. And I never went back. So I do have an appointment tomorrow with a different psychiatrist to see if I can get some more help. Because I find working is very hard because of my problems with my stomach and my breathing. So I'm trying to hopefully get on some disability. You know, I'm 60 years old and finding a job, especially especially in these times, is not that easy. So we'll see what happens. Because I don't, I need some income, you know, and I can't, I'm a little bit too young to retire, so. I need to be put on disability. So hopefully I can get some help. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? None. Absolutely none. sad to say but it's true like I said I don't go on a regular basis so it's been a while we'll see what happens tomorrow I feel pretty happy right now and we went and when I'm with my fiance I'm always happy because she's a very upbeat positive person and we're in love and nothing like being in love so that's what I'm most happy when I'm with her because we have a lot in common and we have fun together I love her yeah she's very supportive yes she has been yes for the last three years yeah well I met her when she she's a paralegal and I met her during the time when my mom passed away and she was worked for the attorney that was helping us with the selling of the house and the dividing of the money and this and that and we kind of went out for a cup of coffee and we started to enjoy each other's company. How would your best friend describe you? Friendly, dependable, reliable. That's good. Yeah. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, it was my 60th birthday the other day, And so my fianc????????? made me a nice dinner and we spent the weekend together and we went to the beach and we just had a good old time sitting in the backyard and barbecuing and enjoying ourselves. That was great. Nice. Yeah, it was great. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, that I'm 60 years old and still have a full head of airly healthy and about to be married.

The people, the weather, the food. That's basically it. What are some things you don't really like about LA? What are some things you don't really like about the life? Gangs. Seems to be a lack of snooty people here. Kind of stuck up because being from Beverly Hills or Burbank. and some phonies that are really not themselves. They're imitations. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? I used to. When I was with the Merchant Marines, I traveled all over the world. I've been to Australia. I've been to a road to Spain, Norway, England, Scotland. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed traveling. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting different people, meeting different cultures, speaking the language. I speak a few languages, different languages. I speak Tagalog, I speak some Japanese, I speak some Thai. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. Well I spent four years in Japan. I enjoyed living in Japan. People are very friendly there. I got to climb Mount Fujiyama. That was a trip in itself to travel Mount Fuji. The food is good. I like katsudon, and I like sashimi and yakitori. The cherry blossoms only comes out once a year.

I really don't have many family values. Me and my brother are 13 years apart in age, so I really don't know my brother that well. So I really don't know much of a family life. We never sat down at the table together and had meals together. It was always like separate times. One would come in and eat, another one would come in and eat. We never sat down at the same table. So I don't know much about family life. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I listen to music and I listen to relaxing, relaxation music like chimes, a brook, water running, stuff like that. How are you at controlling your timbre? I'm on medication right now. I get aggravated real easily, mood swings, personality disorder. But sometimes it just flares up depending on the situation if somebody gets in my face. But I try not to let it happen because I know the circumstances. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? It was on a bus. I was sitting in the back on the bus and the guy came back and he wanted me to move so he could sit down. But I'm a big guy and he's a big guy. So I decided just to get up and let him have the seat. I didn't want to get in no confrontation. I just let it go. that had to be meeting a girl that I've known for 18 years she's had two children with this guy and now the guy is going to be part of the family and I feel very comfortable about that but I still have feelings for this girl but I know that the father of the boys they're not married he's going to be involved with the family and I don't like that What's something you feel guilty about? That's a good one. Back in 2010, I went back for my mom's funeral and my brother was hard up for money. and he took his IRA out and spent it and I had promised him I was going to pay him back. I wasn't able to pay him back and he held it against me. So I felt guilty about that because I made a promise and I didn't keep it. But there was more circumstances into that and he doesn't understand. He didn't write to me. He didn't call me. He didn't do a lot of things. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I ever had to make was when I was with the Merchant Marines. I was very comfortable being at sea and my wife at the time, she wanted me to stop sailing and just get a regular 9 to 5 job where I would have been very comfortable staying at sea and working on ships because I loved that. That was what I loved. But she didn't like that so she'd rather me work 9 to 5. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Dead bodies? I always see a lot of dead bodies. I had circumstances in the military where I recovered a dead body in the Philippines. A boy had jumped ship, and we recovered the body underneath the pier. And I had to pull the body out and put it in a body bag. And another incident was in boot camp. there was circumstances where me and this guy got letters all the time from our girls but he was engaged and he committed suicide because the girl dumped him for another guy and it crushed him and he ended up jumping three feet in front of me while I was in barracks duty and I seen his head explode like a pumpkin and it affected me greatly. I see that all the time. Have you ever served in the military? Yes, I was in the Navy 15 years and two with the Merchant Marines. How old were you when you joined the military? 24. Why did you decide to move to the military? A family thing. My father was in the Navy. My cousins was in the Air Force. My other uncle was in the Marine Corps. I just wanted to serve my country. Are you happy you did that? Yes. I love my country. USA. day serving the military. No regrets. Did you ever see combat? No but we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf. We had weapons pointing at us while had weapons pointing at us while we escorted Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf. But I never saw combat. I was never in a combat situation. Never had to fire a gun at somebody. So I don't know what it was like. What I'm traveling through is, going through is non-combat PTSD, which means I was in a combat zone. I'm sorry. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first it was hard. I was collecting unemployment for 18 months. Then after the unemployment ran out I had to get a job. So I got various jobs, work in security and refineries and I tried to stay biddy the best I could. It was okay. I'm sorry. What did you do after the military? I worked refineries. I worked security. I worked for wineries, security guard for wineries. I did a little odds and ends so I was able to get a full-time job. and that was with the Merchant Marines. I went to the Coast Guard and applied for JMED, I forgot. But anyway, I worked for engineering. What did serving in the military change you? It made me a better person. I was in a scared, when I first joined I was kind of scared, but then joining the military it made me a lot tougher and stronger. I stood up for my own grounds. I wasn't being pushed around. And I just like people applauding when you would walk into a place and they would appreciate what you did for your country made it all worthwhile. Depressed, mood swings, high anxiety, isolation. I have no social life. I don't have much of communication with women. I don't know how to act around them. So I like to stay to myself. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or self-esteem? I'm getting out more. Before I was always staying in my room, but now I'm making the effort to go out to see things. I go to movies. I go out for dinner by myself. So my behavior has changed somewhat. I'm not staying in like I used to, you know. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's not. I have insomnia. I see dead bodies. I'm on risperidone and trapezode, which supposedly help me sleep, but sometimes I only get like three hours sleep. I'm up half the night. I don't sleep too well. What are you like when you don't sleep well? What was the question? All right. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes, non-combat PTSD. It's because of circumstances that happened, trauma, while I was in the Navy. And I'm going through group sessions now on Wednesday. I sit in classes and we talk about it. In fact, August 28th I graduate from my class and get a certificate, so that's a good thing about it. How long ago were you diagnosed? A year ago. What were your symptoms? Cold sweats, nightmares, insomnia, just jittery, always looking over my shoulder, don't feel comfortable around people, don't trust people. Are you triggered by something? No. No. I like to change. Can we change the subject? You're persistent. What brought you to seek help? What brought me to seek help? Brought me to seek help was I got tired of nightmares. I got tired of staying up. Got tired of being jittery. Got tired of the cold sweats. I just got tired of all those things. and antsy and jittery and just, you know, just didn't feel comfortable. Yes. Every Wednesday, 3 o'clock, 3 to 4. Yes. I do. I understand some things that I didn't understand before. And as a group, there's six of us in the group and we help each other. We give advice to each other. And it works out pretty well. Can you tell me about that? Well, we got Marines, Navy, Army, and Air Force. And what we do, we share experiences of what we experienced. Right now, we're going through a lot of problems with our daughters and relationships with the daughters that a lot of times we don't feel comfortable with our daughters because somewhere or another we have done either harm to them or something we haven't worked with them or worked out with them, and now we're trying to build that relationship up. What sort of changes have you noticed as you've been going to therapy? Kind of changes. When was the last time you felt really happy? It's been hard for me. I've slept in homeless shelters and slept in garages and closets. So I really haven't had a kind life, you know. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Influence in my life? My psychologist. He's been good for me, Tim Morrissey. and my counselor I have in PTSD. It's been good for me also. I also have a friend over at the... He's been a real good friend for me. We talk a lot, and I think we're good for each other. We both suffer through the same thing, bipolar and PTSD. How would your best friend describe you? Neurotic. I'm a mess. He says I'm worse off than what I say I am. I'm just in bad shape. There hasn't been any. I haven't really gone anywhere, you know. But I'm going to in September. I'm going to Philadelphia, so I'm looking forward to see that. That's going to be a big thing for me, going to Philadelphia, getting out of California for a while. So I'll be able to tell you more about that when I come back from Philadelphia. What are you most proud of in your life? A woman. I'm lonely. I'm 58 years old, looking for some companionship. But I'm afraid to go out there and ask. Because I don't know how to act or I don't know what to say to the woman. And plus being on medication, I don't know how she's going to act on that, you know. Sometimes I over-medicate myself when I take my medication. So I'm not that good of a person to be around, you know. I sleep a lot. That's good. Okay. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay. Yeah. And then you can take off the headset microphone.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/680_P/680_AUDIO.wav,2

The same as if I get a lot of sleep in my own opinion, but I think probably less focused, less able to focus. But getting sleep lately has been tough. I go to sleep okay, but I just wake up in a few hours and then back to sleep. because I got to urinate, but that's probably a lot of other things too. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Uh-huh. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yeah, that was one of the questions on there, but it needs clarification, and that's why I check no on that yes but it was I was part of an experiment with taking interferon and copaegus ribavirin to try to cure hepatitis and those those two drugs caused depression so I was chemically depressed as opposed to clinically there's a difference and so there was some psychiatric help and some medication to help me get beyond that took 11 months of treatment with that it was tough don't recommend it to anybody interferon is a killer don't do it that treatment ended probably and all of the symptoms with it probably three to five years ago three years ago I think Nightmares, intense itching, thoughts of suicide, and vivid, terrifying nightmares. That's interferon. Are you triggered by something? and Cobega's Ribavirin, two drugs that they use to treat cancer and also in the treatment of hepatitis C currently, in addition to a third drug that they used. I can't think of the name of it. How do you cope with them? Well, I seem to be okay now. It's skin damage. My body broke out in a full body rash. caused intense itching full and fully engulf the body with full intense itching almost made me jump out a window but i held on the itching we're talking about chemical you know caused being chemically induced as opposed to psychologically no most worthless piece of crap I ever went through uh out of 10 therapists that I talked to at the VA, maybe two actually knew what they were doing, and two were sincerely concerned about what they were doing. The rest were just collecting a paycheck. Tell me more about that. Well, they were incompetent, just asking foolish questions. One, even we were supposed to be talking about some of my personal things in life, and she was playing little games like purposely leaving a purse on the table to see. She was using psychology 101 that you would learn in college or something. It was so obvious that she didn't know what she was doing. Just going down the book by the numbers that the way that she was taught to proceed with someone as opposed to actually knowing how to proceed with someone. It was funny, actually. It was actually funny. Sad. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? That is over. But the changes since going to therapy? Nothing. And all of that depression stuff kind of eased off. And so I'm back to trying to do the things that I was doing before I took that 11 months to go in that experiment. OK. When was the last time you felt really happy? It's been a long time. I usually get a little bit of that daily somewhere. I get a little bit of happiness in there. Just a little. Just enough to keep me sane, I think. That's great. You're someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Yeah, I like to, without being, you know, risking the risk of being cliche ik my father but other than that a positive influence in my life have been many mostly the men that I worked with while working a goal as a younger man there was some of the best the best work experience I've had in my experiences my 30 or 40 years of working the the team of those men and it was probably the same kinship that you would gain from being in combat because it was dangerous work and these guys looked out for each other they took care of each other I'm pretty sure it was pretty much same way for guys that experienced combat and the camaraderie that they had to have with each other because their lives were on the line giving kind but i really enjoy i get a lot of those it could be many things i enjoy the moment you know was driving uh shopping found enjoyment in something some kind of way everything i do you know it's hot gonna open my coat what are you most proud of in your life I want to say my son, but many accomplishments, most proud of in my life, being honest. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Yes.

What's something you feel guilty about? My failures. I don't know because I usually as of lately follow my heart regardless whether I want to or not moving off first instinct it's kind of a mind over matter thing I've put myself in some pretty scary situations but I've just kept on going and gotten out of it.

I'm kind of trying to, I feel like I see the signs from other people, you know, who have been more appreciative of me, and been more supportive of me, you know, going through everything, and are really caring, and I feel like I'm not pushing them away, but I feel like there's a push and pull in a situation, Instead of allowing myself to fall into the situation, I'm pushing myself away from it. You know, it's not a bad situation, but there's an uncertainty to it that I'm feeling. Whether I'm as contrived about my thoughts, and I don't even speak on them. I don't even say hey because I feel that I'm wrong and if I do it'll be not an embarrassing moment but it'll change the entire situation of something. So I don't want to cross that boundary. Which is kind of, it's so like right there in my face but yet I'm not looking at it. And it's frustrating. I'm sorry. It's okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not since yesterday. I'm pretty consistent. No, it's been pretty consistent. That's good. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I end up falling asleep. I end up waking up late.

The medication they have me on is messing with my mood. It's just, it's a whole big mix-up. And I need to be more assertive. And I'm trying to not be so aggressive and assertive, but just to be, let them know that, hey, this is what needs to happen. Can you repeat the question? What got me to seek help? Well, I was going through a spiritual journey and my mom didn't like it. That sounds hard. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. All right. Do you feel therapy is useful? Yeah, highly. well I'm able to I'm able to get more to the bottom of things I'm able to understand myself a little bit better me to understand the issues of things better. Um.

Not very nice. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? About two years ago. What were your symptoms? I don't like crowds, loud noises, fear of people being behind me, almost a general fear of people when I don't know what their intentions are. Are you triggered by something? Um, maybe their actions, their movements, um, maybe sometimes what they say. Can you tell me about that? Um, growing up, I started in gangs at about 13, and, um, I seen a lot of bad things happen. and since I didn't have a great childhood, I was never at home. I was more in the streets than at home. So I've seen some things that kids shouldn't have been exposed to and therefore I got involved with some things kids shouldn't have been involved in. That's something I regret also. I can't believe I'm being this honest. prayer a lot of prayer since I've been in recovery I found what some people call her higher power I believe in God growing up I really didn't believe there was a god not by what I experienced and I went through can't believe I'm being this honest with a character it's it's brought me peace peace in my life something I needed very much and I enjoy I couldn't take it no more I was tired of being locked up going in and out of of jails prisons I've been arrested so many times I lost count the lifestyle that's why I meant about the lifestyle being in LA it'll wear you down if you don't die first so I got tired of living that way um you almost become an animal times and um you become less than a human being it's no way to live life it adds moments yes every day except Saturday and Sunday Do you feel therapy is useful? Oh very useful. Gives you a way to um, figure out your feelings, your thought process, um, channel your emotions. It actually um, helps teach you how to deal with your emotions and um, can make you aware of what brings out certain emotions, um, certain pain, um, certain anger issues, um, things that you wouldn't generally talk about. Just like I'm here talking to you right now, normally I would never do something like this. In fact, I'm kind of amazed I'm doing it right now. Tell me more about that. um i generally don't trust people so here i am talking to a virtual person when i know somebody on their side who i have no idea who you are and um before this would never happen i wouldn't i wouldn't be as open as i am now because i honestly believe it's none of your business and um anything i had to say you could only use against me but now um i'm learning recovery I have nothing to hide. I'm not proud of things I've done, but I've learned to accept them because I can't change them. For the mistakes I've made, I'm learning to be a better person. In some ways, I think it's made me a better person than people who haven't been through what I've been through because they have less compassion. I can feel more empathy for others and compassion for others because of what I've been through compared to someone who has it I stay out of trouble I'm more trusting because right now this is really just this is really messing with my head sitting here talking to you this is really a trip peaceful I don't have my anger issues no more no hostilities no no more dreams That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? That's great. Who's some of it's been a positive influence in your life? Some of my counselors. Also some of the people that I've been in therapy with. All of us are veterans where I go to therapy so a lot of us have been through some really traumatic events and some of us are really overcoming some deep issues in a positive way which is um it's really how my best friend described me my best friend hasn't seen me since I've been in recovery so he described me as being loyal honest straight up but um volatile wouldn't take nothing for nobody no flack but a good person to have on your side always loyal I did something for my roommate. He's dying of a disease where his brain's deteriorating slowly. He's only 30 years old. And he inspires me because he's got such courage every day. He's always in a good mood. Even though he's suffering from what he's suffering, you would never know. So he inspires me. So at times I tend to feel like I want to give him something back because he gives me so much every day. So sometimes I'll go out and I'll buy us a couple steaks or I know he loves cheesecake so I'll go out and get him a cheesecake. because at 30 years old to be suffering from the disease they suffering from where his brain is deteriorating slowly so he's losing all muscle control he's starting to lose his eyesight this is like a slow killer which will progress in speed I guess as time goes on but he doesn't let slow him down and um he's always good people and that that inspires me to be a better person so I have none but respect and love for him so in turn I try and do whatever I can for him sometimes when our vets are trying to push him around I sort of like stand up for him because I don't believe in how he's a little guy so I don't believe in nobody pushing around little guys thank you still i don't think i've accomplished anything that i'm really that proud of yet um i'm working towards that but um honestly everything i've done so far i feel like um it's nothing really i should claim as being proud of you know um even my changes i made it's just a a part of all being a decent human being as far as actually doing something that I feel like it claimed to be proud of I haven't reached that plateau yet I hope to though one day Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to.

That's where I went to all my school when I was a military brat. What are some things you really like about LA? I really like just like the size of the town.

Do you travel a lot? Excuse me? What's one of your most memorable experiences? Let's see. Really my memory is not really that great. Lately I've been thinking a lot about when I was in Japan as a child, going up to Camp Malzuma. What did you study at school? I studied x-ray technology. I was an x-ray technician for a couple years until I lost my license because of drug addiction. I'm now retired. I really don't do anything. I wouldn't mind working again, but I'd lose my benefits if I do, so with the economy being what it is, there's not a whole lot to do. What's your dream job? I'm sorry? Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm a pretty shy person. I find it difficult to make friends. A lot of trust issues, I guess. Why? I just don't really know I guess uh experiences in my past really our family was never very close I mean we're a military family pretty much everybody did their own thing I mean we did all get together for sit down never every now but it was usually watching TV watch a lot of movies just just uh... stretch out of my recliner actually i don't really have much of a temper it kinda takes a lot to set me off as far as getting angry so i don't really have a problem with my temper at all Wow. Well, um, well, last night somebody was actually, yesterday was just sort of something stupid about having individuals that aren't medically trained to put your back back in place, cracking your spine. Mm-hmm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Whatever comes to mind. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently, whatever comes to your mind. Well, my last assignment when I was in the military, I was dating this really good woman. I wish I kind of had never broken off the relationship with her. I mean, I think my my life would have went a whole different direction had I stayed with her. I feel good about the way I broke it off with her. Let her come all the way out here from Virginia to Texas where I was staying at the time. Then drop the bomber. I don't think we have a future together. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't know. I really can't think of anything. I mean... Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I wish I could risk all that time that I was out there doing drugs and just screwing up my life. Wish I'd never even started. Have you ever served in the military? Yeah, I spent 11 years in the army. I got down after the, when they were doing the drawdown after the first gulf war storm started understand the question or here i'm sorry i didn't dick as i was talking we were good uh... my thoughts not really seems like a lot of times it's bill blank welcome now really think about it and for like a mile no i did i would never so i thought i was supposed to deploy go there but by the time might want to roll around the war was already over Actually it was pretty easy. I mean I was pretty hard charged and I already knew what I wanted to do. Go to x-ray school, get my degree, start being an x-ray technician, which I did. So I kind of screwed that up by getting involved with drugs. Okay. What did you do after the military? Well, I went back to school full time. I mean, I got a severance pay when I got out, so I was able to go and pay my rent up. For the two years I was in school, I didn't have to work or worry about it. I just lived off my GI Bill. Um, transition was pretty easy. I mean, every now and then there were points and times that I missed. I missed the camaraderie. I'm sorry. How did serving in the military change you? Well, I mean, it gave me more focus. I was ready to go back to school, which is something I could have gone to college right when I was in high school. I just was tired of school in the military kind of helped me calm down and get my thoughts organized and basically just got me focused to go back to school. How have you been feeling lately? How do I feel lately? lately lately i've just uh... little tired worn out uh... just don't feel like i have any energy to really do anything Changes are, like I said, it just seems like recently I just can't get started, motivated to do anything.

How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Well, when I take my Seroquel, which is pretty much every night, I sleep pretty good.

It's kind of hard making that adjustment from being able to tell people what to do and have them do it and then come out and you can't get a job and people are telling you what to do. know the structure was different so it's a little difficult. I'm sorry. That's okay. You didn't do it. What did you do after the military? Uh I started working at a power plant, though doing some painting and I've had a bunch of different jobs since then.

I was mad at everything for nothing. I don't sleep. I'm always... I hate crowds. I don't like going into confined spaces. So, you know, strange places I've never been before and there's a lot of people I don't like going to. So, yeah, I don't like people getting too close to me. Are they triggered by something? You know, that's a good answer. I mean, good question. I don't know. It's just crowds and strange people coming in close to me and everything else. I don't know. That might be it. That's just what it is, but I'm always wondering what the next person is going to do when they get that close to me, especially in a crowded room where you can't move around as much. I'm always watching the whole everything, trying to see who's going to do what and when. How do you cope with them? Usually, I try and get away from the crowd. That's how I cope with them.

Okay. What got you to seek help? A friend of mine who I used to serve in the Navy with, he told me I should go. I should go and actually check out what's going on with my back but when I got in there I started talking to a the first place I went was the mental health ward and told him what was going on with me you know about my attitudes and my harmful thoughts to other people and that's what got me here but I got to say a friend of mine suggested that I go now?

You know, it's a trip, I'm telling you. You know what I'm saying? Just to have that thought all the time with a complete stranger who really doesn't pose a threat to you, it's a trip. What sort of changes have you noticed in your life? I'm a little more tolerant. I don't fly off the handle as much as I used to. you know stuff that used to piss me off like you know saying little things I don't really get too upset about it may upset me but my reactions are different I don't like I said I don't explode because everything I mean the smallest thing would send me you know saying over the top but not so much no more you know I kind of breathe in and take it in stride or try to you know so yeah it's it's working it helps oh man uh really happy oh my god you know that uh it's been some years it's been some years i can't even really put a finger on when i actually felt really happy so you know because it's always been i might have moments where you know say everything's cool and it's a good day or whatever but i'm still throughout the day there's those thoughts will creep in and you know i'm saying i'm looking at people this that this way and that.

Going to Japan and going into the mountains to one of the martial arts studios, or schools, I would say that. What did you study at school? Oh, I have so many things.

When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? It was yesterday. It was about children playing. One of the veterans took it upon himself to sort of like stalk two or three of the children anticipating that they were in the wrong and he was going to take it upon himself to correct it when it was not his place. So I got into an argument, not necessarily an argument, but leave the babies alone. That's why we fight and die, in order for them to have this kind of freedom. So let them be. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently, whatever comes to your mind. 1967, I wish I would not have asked or gained the attention of my superiors asking for a state of conscious objection. Then it caused me a lot of problems in the war zone. What's something you feel guilty about? Killing someone that didn't deserve to die. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. To allow in the, um, to attempt to kill someone at my own, um, expense. was sort of like suicidal attempt to kill someone else didn't make sense after I thought about it make completely a lot of sense then Sometimes a couple of years of my life, basically in the war zone.

How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? No. Without a mate, it's difficult. It's difficult, period. I'll say it like that. Even with a mate, it's difficult. Without Syracuse, I might not go to sleep. I'll say it like that. Lately, I've been doing the best I can to try not to use it to go to sleep. and there's a small bit of success there. A few hours less sleep, but still success at not using it and going and falling asleep. Waking up quite often, but yet still without the medication and falling asleep. With both eyes closed. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I feel like I'm back in the war zone. I'm quite attentive. Very serious. And wondering where I belong at that time. What should I be doing? I'm in a state of limbo, so to speak. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes ma'am, I have. 50% service connected at this point. Okay. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I guess that's part of PTSD. Depression is part of my life. I've learned to live with it. it. I don't know 10, 15 years, 20 years. I don't remember. It's been a while. No sleep. nightmares waking up fighting I don't know what you're I don't know what you're good I don't know what you're me to kick my wife out of the bed night give her a black eye and all that kinda of shit. I don't know. Other than, maybe I'm still in Vietnam sometimes. Or it's still in me. I'm already a bit, but it's in me. Seriously. Very seriously. Tell me more about that. If there was no such thing as a post-traumatic stress program, for the sake of self-preservation, I need to research my own psychological profile the best I can with what has been made available through books and other people's studies and other people's experience with it. Try to apply some of the solutions. It's basically it. Philosophy. Metaphysics. Prayer. Meditation. What got you to seek help? The safety of my family, for me. Oh, right. Do you still go to therapy now? I hope to be reinstated into some kind of therapy. So my intent is to, I haven't in the past year, I want to go back into therapy. I feel I need to. All the things that I think is may not be. The way that I see things may not be correct. my perspective just may be all for I don't know so I need other people's feedback I'm starting to learn I do need people yes In a feedback circumstance or situation where I'm getting live feedback from men of the same experience. Maybe not the same individual experience but the same experience overall. Seeing someone else's perspective of the same view. intrusive thoughts are not as not as profound speaking out and realizing that there is quite a deep problem helps me to realize I need to dig pretty deep it's an inside job there's nothing to do what is what's happening outside of me as I merely well as I thought when I first came home not to be welcome home to be a baby killer to be spit at all those things determine my decision-making which at this point now I realize it's what's happening inside of me not outside of me that makes the difference and that's making the difference When was the last time you felt really happy? That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say first of all Mr. Gray for establishing the village Cabrillo and all the things that benefit the veteran and welcome him home. Who is the property manager, my case manager, and so many other people that are involved my healing I appreciate them I'm loving the fact that they're there and are here for me so that I can be here and there for someone else when my turn comes I would say my best friend is my mother and what a best friend I'm just Learning how to be a friend. I don't really know how because we weren't allowed to make friends over there. We lose them and then that would hurt so bad not to know how to detach. So I learned exactly how to stay detached from beings and people and practice it so long it's difficult. Well, I don't agree with you, but it's okay. We can agree to disagree on this one. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. talking to a virtual reality person this has been an enjoyment to a degree a fine degree because it's challenging my imagination nice What are you most proud of in your life?

Helping elderly. What's your dream job? Oh, dream job. Working from home on a computer. Selling products. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I would say I'm right there a little both not too shy a lot outgoing I guess that's why I picked the National Guard signal operators always outdoors and you're away from people you got more time to think and then more or less you look forward to what you have personally and don't have, if that makes any sense. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, we're a close knit family. family and just kind of arguing my sister and she's on my undo list but other than that we're very close-knit family we lost my mother four years ago and it keeps us closer we lost our dad over ten years ago so you know it just keeps us closer you know we don't let nothing bother us we always love each other I turn on the fish tank screensaver.

I listen to ELO, all my old music, just to relax, have some chocolate, popcorn, not think about anything, just listen to music. That's me. How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I got irritated with them because I was trying to get in my sister's house and he had the key and I don't know what I did with mine. We just had a little spat and he wouldn't let me in and that got me frustrated. That was that. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. About three months ago I got in an argument with my sister and I wish I wasn't drinking at the time. I could have just waited a couple more days and gone back and settled the score, talked. What's something you feel guilty about? My daughter, my youngest daughter, she's having issues with her substance abuse and sometimes I blame myself for that. for that. I never was into any kind of drugs or anything like that. But sometimes I, because I am an alcoholic, that sometimes I feel that maybe it was kind of some of my fault. But I really, I just feel like maybe I could help more. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, when my father was in the hospital, we were having a discussion about him taking him off life support or not. It was since I'm the oldest brother, but my stepbrother was the youngest and he was living with them at the time so it was kind of hard with the fact that the brother is more or less handling the situation it was kind of rough tell me about mid-life or something that you wish you could erase from your memory some the getting up drunk and stupid wrecking my car my first marriage i knew it was because of my drinking I wish I went along with help myself or got help sooner than I did. I blame myself for my first marriage not ending in a good way. Have you ever served in the military? No, yes I have. I was going to join the regular army, but they wanted to send me overseas to Germany and my kids, my two boys at the time were too young and I was in 82 and I didn't want to go to Germany so I wound up staying here. They wouldn't send me stateside or close so I just joined the National Guard and I've been in there 27 years just in the National Guard and I enjoyed myself very much. How old were you when you joined the military? I was 25 and it was like I said it pardon me oh well I was 25 turned 26 during basic training it was fun different yes I was very because I was getting in a rut going through my divorce and all that and trying to handle my kid my two boys and I'm glad I went through it like basic it just made me feel better about myself and like I said I wanted to signal operations or radio operator and I enjoyed it to the fullest no I haven't The only combat was during the riots here in California. And that's the first time I ever loaded my weapon. And thank God I didn't have to go overseas. All right. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Pretty much easy. I really didn't have no conflict with civilian life at all. I worked with the National Guard. If I didn't have any work on the civilian side, I was found work with the Guard, so it made it kind of easy. That's why I enjoyed the National Guard so much. It was good for me, and I hope it was good for them. What did you do after the military? I just did part time work here and there, help friends, some yard work. I wasn't too sure what I wanted to do and then I started looking into PCA, the personal care assistant for a while and that's when I decided maybe I'll get into that field and that's what I'm going to start doing now. How did serving in the military change you? Oh, mentally tough. That's changed me a lot, you know. Have more self-control and just be more aware of my actions. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. I was a little depressed about the fight over my sister because we really, you know, she's one of my best sisters and she just, she's having issues of herself so I didn't want to get too ugg on her, you know, so I decided to just take care of her. Have you ever studied changes in her behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. More mellowed out. I think I'm just trying to focus on myself, you know, what I want to do, where I want to get now. You know, I don't have no outside interference right now, so it's just working on right now. All right. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Lately real good. I started working about 10 days ago. I haven't worked in over a year. I had surgery on my gut. It's been a year since I really went out and did some labor. It's different right now. What are you like when you just leave home? I'm always curious why am I not sleeping and now I'm not drinking or nothing like that so now I can really get some good sleep. I don't know what it was before my drinking or just having doubts about myself. I'm not sure. I really didn't know. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No ma'am. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. I think that's I drank but I really wasn't that depressed. I think boredom. I wasn't getting up and going about doing more. I was just like being a bum. Like I said, I had surgery and I had a hernia and it took almost a year for me to get up and about. So now I feel better about myself and I'm like I'm ready to go, go, go. When was the last time you felt really happy? Well, I'm happy I came into this program. It's helped me to understand myself and what really my goals are. And like I said, I have no outside interference and me and my girlfriend are starting to see eye to eye. And I hope everything works out and, you know, go to school and take care of myself. And I hope I can relate more to what's going to happen to me in the future, which I hope is everything positive coming out of this program. That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Just my kids, you know. I know I haven't been the best father, but they're there for me and I appreciate them.

How are you at controlling your temper? I've learned to control my temper pretty well. Now it takes a lot to get me angry. I'm more passive now than I ever have been, and I like that about myself. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? I argued with my best friend probably. It wasn't like a real serious argument, but we argued a little bit about religion, which I don't like to go into, or I don't like to get into arguments about, but unfortunately we got into an argument about religion. She wanted me to, she wants me to join her religion. I don't feel like it's what I should do, and so we got into a little dispute about that. let's see there's many many many situations that I wish I had to handle differently and one of them was my children I wish I could have been I wish I could have been a better dad to my kids. I wish I could have made better decisions for my children, and I didn't. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about that, about not being a good parent to my kids many times in my life. That guilt stays with me my whole life. Every day I think about it. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let's see the hardest decision I've ever had to make. Alright. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I wish I could erase from my memory the last time that... Getting divorced would be one of the last things. The memory of that relationship going bad was probably one of the things I'd like to erase from my memory. It was the last time I interacted with my ex-wife. Yeah, I was in the Navy. I was 18. Just a kid. Well, to be honest with you, I was 18 years old and I didn't have anywhere else to go. I was homeless, and it was either be homeless on the street at 18 or join the military and try to do something with my life, and so that's what I chose to do. Are you happy you did that? Yeah. In a way, you know, I got out of the military and wished I had stayed in longer. So, yeah, ultimately, yeah, I'm glad I did that. Did you ever see combat? How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? I think it was too easy for me. I adjusted, actually I adjusted real well getting out and getting back into civilian life. I went in with both feet running. And so yeah, it was, it wasn't hard at all. Alright. What did you do after the military? After the military, I worked several different jobs looking and thinking about what career I wanted to choose. I applied for the Sheriff's Department, didn't make the Sheriff's Department, but got into working for different private investigative companies at that time. and that's how I ended up working and getting into workman's comp fraud and different surveillance and investigative aspects of private investigation. So I worked private investigation a little time after getting out of the military. How did serving in the military change you? It taught me honor, it taught me dignity, it taught me respect, it taught me how to listen and obey a chain of command. It kind of grew me up. It grew me up from a kid to a man in a lot of ways. Like I said, I wish I had stayed in longer to have grown more, but I didn't. Mm-hmm. How have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've been feeling just really, I don't know, just kind of worthless, you know, depressed a lot, kind of a little bit worthless. Not feeling like, I don't know, maybe a little lack of hope in a lot of ways. Not knowing what my future holds, I guess you could say. And I don't know, just feeling a little down in the last couple weeks. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yeah, just feeling kind of hopeless and just depressed and not having a lot of energy. And like I said, just feeling down, just feeling down about myself. not feeling worthy, you know, those kind of feelings. All right. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Depends on the night. Sometimes I sleep really well. Other nights it's restless and I have bad dreams, things like that. But lately I've just been kind of feeling depressed. I've been sleeping too much. What are you like when you don't think well? Sometimes I get irritable. I can't think straight. My mind's a jumble. I just can't think straight and irritable and maybe cranky, things like that. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes, yes. I actually take medication for it, I get counseling for it, and I've been dealing with that for a little while now. But yeah, I have been diagnosed with PTSD. How long ago were you diagnosed? me several years ago my earphones coming off a little bit but yeah several years ago tremors at night nightmares depression feeling feeling though something something bad is gonna to happen to me at all times. You know, that's how I felt when I was in the military. I felt like our ship was going to be bombed at any time. Um, just being, feeling a sense of terror a lot of the time. Are they triggered by something? No, that's the strange part about it. It's just, uh, it's just the way I feel. I don't know why it's like that, I can't tell you, but it's the way I've been feeling for years ever since I was in the military, I feel that way now, like we're going to get bombed, something's going to happen at any moment, chaos is going to break out, things like that, and I hate it, I wish it wasn't like that, I wish I didn't think that way. How do you cope with them? isolate sometimes and and and uh try to i pray i i believe in god so i pray and i try to get him to comfort me and and help me you know to get through the the scary feelings i feel and i try to get support from the little friends i have and a few family members i have and I just try to tell myself everything's going to be okay. It's not what I'm thinking. Things aren't the way I think they are in my head. Those kind of coping mechanisms. What got you to seek help? I couldn't take it anymore. I was depressed. I ended up in the hospital. I'm just feeling like I said feeling terror being scared all the time couldn't I just couldn't deal with it anymore so I I ended up getting help and I'm glad I did and it's a day by day struggle I still struggle every day to to just get by but I basically I'm doing okay I'm hanging in there. That sounds hard. It's very hard. Do you still go to therapy now? Yeah. Yeah, I go to therapy, like, probably once a month. I take meds for it. It helps me out a lot. I probably should be going to therapy more, but it's once a month right now. Alright. Do you feel therapy is useful? I think it's useful if you're serious about it and you take it seriously and you have the right therapist and everything is, the right dynamics are there. I think it's very useful. Yeah. Tell me more about that. Well, I think that if you're going just to go, it's not going to help. If you're going to seek the true answers to get help, I think it's going to work. You're going to get help. Things will work out. But if you've got the wrong person to talk to, the chemistry is not there or the education or whatever dynamics are involved aren't working, they're not in sync with each other, either on your side or the therapist, it's going to be more difficult for the solution to be a positive one, I think. I don't know. I don't know if I said that properly, but basically, yeah. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? What sort of changes have I noticed? I'm more of a positive person actually than I ever have been was completely negative about everything for so many years I'm more positive, I have more hope even though I have days of hopelessness I have more hope, I feel more secure within myself and I feel like I've got a release I've got somebody that I can talk to So, that understands me and somebody that I could really relate with. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? You know... Tell me more about that. I don't remember the last time I was very happy. To be honest with you, I don't remember. It's, uh... I don't remember. It's been a long time. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Let's see. My brother, my older brother. He's a real positive influence in my life. My best friend. She's a real super positive person in my life. Every time I start talking negative or looking down on things, she always reminds me to be positive, be positive, and that helps a lot. And she's there to encourage me. And those two people right there play a big role in my life. How would your best friend describe you? oh boy I think she'd probably describe me as somebody that needs to take things more seriously when it comes to his health his spirituality life itself somebody that has a lot of issues but yet she cares very much about. Let's see something I've done recently that I've really enjoyed that I've really enjoyed. I enjoyed going over my brother's house and watching seeing him work on his Harley Davidson. building a Harley Davidson from the ground up so I enjoyed going over there and seeing him get almost finished building this Harley from the ground up that was something I really enjoyed doing I guess it would...

Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Oh boy, um... I uh... I really can't think of one right now. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh, probably some of my earlier years in my early 20s, some of the things I've done. Yes. 17 and a half. Why'd you decide to move to the military? Well, about five or six of my friends were going in, so I wanted to go with them. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I kind of wish I would have stayed in, though. Did you ever see combat? No, I didn't. There was no wars going on or conflicts going on while I was serving. I'm sorry. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It was easy. Yeah, I had no problems adjusting. What did you do after the military? I just kind of bounced around from job to job and then I got into a little trouble, went to jail for a little while. Then I got out and pretty much got my life together. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more confident, made me physically stronger too. That's about all I can really think of as far as that goes. How have you been feeling lately? As a rule, pretty good. Can you tell me about that? Just things are starting to look up more, at least financially, so that's a good thing. no not really usually pretty good unless one of my roommates is walking around the house all night like he sometimes does little irritable usually I control the irritability though yes What were your symptoms? I'd say about five years ago and it was just, uh, symptoms were I was hearing voices. Paranoia. Did you get hurt by something? Yes, but it was by an event that happened. Tell me more about that. I am Jewish by birth even though I don't practice and I was jumped by five skinheads and I was able to handle two of them but the other three got me and beat me up pretty good How do you cope with them? You know, I just deal with it as it comes, I guess. Usually I don't even have to deal with skinheads anymore because I don't see them too much, I was in that one situation where it just happened where they happened to be there. I was tired of hearing voices and I knew I was hearing voices. Alright. Do you still go to therapy now? No, I'm pretty much over that. I've learned to overcome. Do you feel therapy is useful? Yeah, I think it can help people. Some people it can't help, just they're too far gone. but I think the majority of people, yes, it can help. Tell me more about that. Well, I think when people have a chance to express or vent what's going on or what's bothering them, it takes away some of the tension and stress, and they're better able to cope with whatever their problem is. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? When was the last time you felt really happy? when I bought my last vehicle. That's good. Who's been a positive influence in your life? My friend. He's been a very positive influence. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, he asked me if I need things. he's helping me to be financially more secure through through working partially with him even though I'm retired I do a little bit of work with him and it's a way to make some extra money that's pretty much needed probably as honest loyal and be there for him whenever he needs me Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I'd say it was a reunion of sorts of the old Hollywood crowd that I used to hang out with. Nice. Yeah, it was fun. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, of the things I had, which I no longer have, but I had accomplished something. I had my own business. I owned two homes, several vehicles, and all the toys and everything that goes with it.

708,19,1," I'm going to start up our camcorder recording and then our virtual hearing will start floating. I'm going to start up our camcorder recording and then I'll go keep you guys kind of floating. Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and start her up. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Sure, go ahead. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm good, Ellie. How are you? That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm Pasadena. Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about L.A.? The weather. I love the weather. I love the people there's so many things to do in LA I love LA you know it's my home and I wouldn't live anywhere else what are some things you don't really like about LA traffic the traffic that's probably the biggest thing it's getting a little crowded that's it I see what you mean Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? clubs and stuff like that and just going somewhere new you know because culturally I appreciate differences so one of my trips uh Japan uh you know uh when I got to Japan uh I only stayed for six months but uh you start to learn more about yourself. I learned more about myself as an American by going overseas and understanding that just because I'm American and I'm from this country, this is not the only country in the world. And millions of people, billions of people actually live a lot different from I do from what we do. And just learning to appreciate the differences, you know, and appreciate myself too. But the trip itself, you know, Actually, six months is not long enough, I think, when you go to a foreign country for me because at the sixth month point, that's exactly when I started to really want it to stay, but it was time to come back. So then again, like I said, traveling, food, customs, just learning more about other cultures. It's real. It's exciting. It's not to mention educational, but I think it's needed. I think a lot of Americans or a lot of just my family members who have never been able to go out of the country need a trip somewhere, you know, out of North America to really understand their place in the world. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Well, probably actually flying to Japan and flying over Alaska, the mountaintops in Alaska. I mean the mountain ranges are so huge and they were all covered with snow, but it looked like we were close enough to actually put our hands out of the plane and touch the top of the snow-capped mountains. I thought that was really exciting. What did you study at school? I was a criminal justice major. What do you do now? I work in the medical field actually. What's your dream job? Dream job? An actor. To be an actor, that would be a dream job. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I have one brother and two sisters. I'm closest to my youngest sister. She just had the first grandchild in the group of my siblings, you know, a couple of years ago. So I have a nephew. She lives in Oregon. My other sister lives here in the L.A. area. My brother lives in Oakland. I would like to visit. I would like for us to all be together, you know, more than we are, but we're not. So we do the best we can. But my relationship is pretty strong. My mom, she lives down in San Diego and I try to talk to her at least once a week and get to go down there and see her every every now and then. My father passed away in 04. And for the extended family, we usually get together on holidays, mainly Thanksgiving and Christmas. and keeping contact like everybody else now on Facebook. I'll go to the gym. Go to the gym or maybe, you know, sometimes now as I'm getting older, I realize when I take a nap, that kind of helps me to relax, wake up refreshed and I'm ready to go. I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. You know, like everyone else I have, I've got pet peeves and if it's one of the peeves I might tend to get a little angrier than some of the other things that you know tend to bother me but overall I control my anger pretty well. The last argument, wow, I don't remember. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. that I would have handled differently. Let's see. I had a laptop and I was over a acquaintance home and my laptop disappeared. And I didn't get angry. I was just really too calm and nonchalant about the whole incident. And as I look back on it, I should have been a little bit more assertive about them finding my laptop or you know finding out what happened and I kind of just let that go and um didn't say much what's something you feel guilty about I feel guilty about uh not working out as often as I should the hardest decision I ever had to make uh I haven't had any hard decisions um hard decisions uh staying in LA and not moving back to Philadelphia um that was a hard decision you know I lived in Philadelphia for a couple of years and I moved back home. But I wanted to move back, but I didn't. I stayed here. You know, that was a hard decision. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably the abuse my father exhibited towards my mother as a child. Have you ever served in the military? Yes. How old were you when you joined the military? 18. Why did you decide to join the military? A lot of members of my family had been in the military and I don't think I was ready ready for college at that point so I actually signed the papers when I was 17 for the delayed entry program and went in after graduation. Yes, extremely. No combat, no. I'm sorry to hear that. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? The transition was more difficult than I anticipated. It was strange, even though I had been in the military for those years and I had really become a different type of person. And it took a little while, but it happens. they have a thing called separation for about the last two months before your discharge where it kind of helps you get ready or prepares you back to get into civilian life. So it takes a little while but it happens. It takes a while. Some people it takes longer, you know, some people it doesn't take as long. What did you do after the military? I went to school. How did serving in the military change you? It allowed me to mature. I don't think I met, I don't know if I would have gotten that when I went to college right after high school or not, but it allowed me to also be on my own and kind of find out who I was and grow up. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling great. I don't have any worries or complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. I'm a light sleeper but I sleep pretty well. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Grumpy. Irritated. Easily. Not too pleasant to be around. No. Yes. Really happy? Well, probably last week, last Wednesday. My father. Tell me more about that. Well, I mean, I think one of the things I got from my father was to always be positive and a level of determination is to basically never give up on what you want to do. How would your best friend describe you? a good friend, funny, caring, giving. Volunteering for charity, helping serve food to other individuals. My track and field trophies. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Well, thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.

I tried going to school for a little bit. It was boring. I just can't get into it. So I just decided to go to work. How did serving in the military change you?

To win the lottery. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's a good relationship. My mother passed away, unfortunately, but my dad's up north. He's 85, and he stays with my sister now, and we all get along. maybe take a ride to the ocean and sit there and kind of look out to sea good I used to have a temper years ago when I was younger but I'm a little calmer and older and hopefully wiser these days in the past it has but not as of recent to be honest I don't even remember that's how long ago it's been my divorce I guess I probably should have got it sooner what's something you feel guilty about I don't feel guilty about anything hmm tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make probably divorce whether to stay married or to get divorced it was a tough decision definitely I guess just seeing death in the past and situations that if I could erase some of the visuals of that that would help me Yes. Yes. I think it was 17 and a half. I really wanted to get out of my hometown. There wasn't much there, jobs or advancement in jobs. So I wanted to see the world because my father was in the military. Are you happy to do that? Definitely, yes. Okay. Did you ever see combat? Yes. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? It was difficult because you're used to a structured military life and then to come back and have less organization. It was a transition plus going from different places overseas and coming back and speaking English and not seeing the other people that you were stationed with. So, you know, you miss some of those people. I got stationed in Southern California on my last assignment, so I applied for the power company and was working for them for a while. Roughly 20 years. I'm sorry to hear that. How did serving in the military change you? More organization, learned more responsibility, kind of more of a manly attitude, organization, and discipline. Discipline helps in life. That's great. How have you been feeling lately? Good, not too bad. Mentally alright, physically aches and pains. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I seem a little more calm and more tolerable of situations, less arguing or none at all. all. I just try to keep things less dramatic and smooth in my life. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not real easy. Sometimes it's hard. I can have some nightmares or just thinking too much and can't sleep or can't get comfortable or physical aches and pains. So there's a lot that contributes to that. Just a little irritable. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I think like six years ago. Five, six years ago. What were your symptoms? I'm not sure. I guess lack of sleep and chewing my nails and maybe a lack of concentration on some things. evidently that's basically it I mean I've been I I've uh I haven't experienced that much as of recent but that was more like five years ago so things are better now relaxation breathing exercise just basically try to live peaceful life past experiences I guess to know I'm a lot more in control and doing better Yes. Well, it's nice to talk to someone about your problems like, or tell someone your problems like I am now with you. Less nightmares, probably better sleep and just going through day to day a lot calmer without argument or letting little things bother me. When was the last time you felt really happy? Last night. I was with friends and we went to the beach and to a concert. That's great. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My father, he's very positive and a good man. Tell me more about that. Just the man that raised me, he's also a veteran and instilled some discipline and good work and study habits. So he was a good father and good provider. How would your best friend describe you? Funny and crazy. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Last night I was at the beach with friends and saw a concert and had a good time. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? My military service. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/710_P/710_AUDIO.wav,1
712,21,1," Okay, let's go ahead and start up our 10-quarter recording. Mm-hmm. She's going to start. She will sit. Very good. Yep. Okay, can you start it? Sure, very good. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I've been created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes, yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. How are you? Where are you from originally? Philadelphia. Pennsylvania. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. The people. Latin culture. Food. Music. The beaches. What are some things you don't really like about the lake? Parts of it are dirty. Large parts of it. Gang violence, stuff like that. Yeah, that's about it. it. I used to in the Marines and growing up I did yeah all over the East Coast and around the country yeah. The same thing different different types of people different types of food, different types of music, seeing different architecture and things like that. The East Coast and the West Coast is very different in terms of how we build our buildings. So just different places that you go, you see different things like that. I'd like to know about one of your trips. Turkey. We visited the oldest church in the world, I believe it was called, the oldest church in the world. They have those, the towers, the praying towers and just the different people. I eat goat and some other types of food that I had never eaten before and I found out the people are people just like us. It's not just like Americans. We might have our perception but people from another country they're just the same. They just have a different language and they just look different but they don't they're not different you know it was a very good experience I remember everything I have a very vivid memory I remember a lot of things I don't know I was a trumpet player since third grade and I did that in the Marines so I did it for 15 years of my life music warehousing labor and I ride my bike a lot the Los Angeles Philharmonic or the Boston Pops Orchestra or something like that something big something like that though yeah lately outgoing I was shy when I was growing up but not anymore I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Yes. How do you relax? I have music. I love all kinds of music, so if I just put on my headphones, that usually helps. Or I go for a bike ride. I have my bike downstairs. I'll just go for as far as I feel like going, 10, 15, 20 miles, and then come home. That's very relaxing. How are you at controlling your temper? I don't have a temper. I used to, put it this way, my daughter's mother had a temper and I started to learn it from her. But I realized that's, that that's not me, that that's not the type of person that I am. And so I, we separated and I've long since not been like that. Yeah. with her only with her never um never like in public or with the police or anything like that they uh i would say that she some girls know that they can use the police uh they can just say things uh some girls not all girls uh and she would do that but no it was never I've never like hit a woman or anything like that, no. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? My former landlady. I just moved about two months ago. Where I was before, my landlady was a drug addict. She didn't do anything except drugs. She didn't fix anything. She was just lazy and everything was unkempt. And if you are renting to somebody else, I had strong views that you should keep up with the property. And it just built up over time. And I told her, you know, I've been here and I've given you so much money, so much money, and you haven't done anything except drugs. And it was, well, we got heated. A little heated. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. I don't know because I think the way things end up is the right way in the end as long as you learn so people like to say do you have any regrets? I don't know I've learned that you can't have regrets because at the end of the day you end up in the right place and that's what you have to look at. So I don't think so. I've learned from the things that I may have done, but I had to learn. Do you understand? I'm sure you do. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? I might as well be honest. I know it's odd looking at a... I know you're a person on the other side of that, but you don't look like a person. but I had a woman that I was chasing and we were intimate we worked together and we were intimate and she had made me promise not to tell anybody at work and I was so excited and I told somebody because I thought I could trust that person and I couldn't trust that person and word got out and the whole restaurant knew and she was embarrassed and I broke her trust it was pretty bad But at the same time, and this is like, again, I said, I don't regret things because she admitted that it hurt. And by admitting that it hurt, it kind of said more about the situation. If somebody can admit to you that you can hurt them, that means they're vulnerable to you, which says something, you know. I understood that. So I learned something more than maybe had I not done it. Had I not hurt her, I might not have known. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. get money and everything together for me to do it, but I knew when I came out here that I didn't know anybody, we're from the east coast, I didn't know anybody, I didn't know anything about California, I looked at a map, and I said Santa Monica, I know that city, I'll try to get closer there, and when it came time for it, like the few days before, and I knew, I bought a bus ticket, and I packed as much as I could, and I knew that I was moving to the other side of the country, and that I couldn't turn around. It was a huge step. It was a huge step. And I knew why I was doing it, but I was terrified. And I got here and I was still terrified. And it took some time to get everything together, you know, to eventually live with that drug addict that I was with. But for sure, getting up and moving and leaving everything and friends that I knew and starting completely brand new, that was very difficult. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. A lot of my childhood. My parents were abusive and I guess this anonymity thing helps but yeah my parents were destructive. And there's a lot of things that they did to me as a child that I wouldn't wish on other kids. I've learned and I'm a stronger person but I still wouldn't wish it on somebody else. I'm stronger and I can help other people because of the things I know but it doesn't completely justify the stuff that happened. Have you ever served in the military? Yes, the Marines. How old were you when you joined the military? 19. Why did you decide to go to the military? I was actually going to go to college for music, for trumpet, and my parents didn't help me with any of the decisions, and I didn't know how I was going to get there. I was so adamant about still playing, though. So I don't know. I knew the Marines were something that I could do. It would be physical, but I could still keep playing. And it wasn't going to be so... Like, my parents wouldn't have driven me to college or anything like that, and I had no idea how I was going to make that step. I think I felt that the military was going to be an easier step, so to speak. I don't know if that makes sense, but yeah. It was more streamlined just to get in the military and keep playing that way. Are you happy with your life? Yeah, I would say I learned a lot from my experiences. Yeah, no regrets, you know what I mean? I can definitely say that as a Marine, having been a Marine, there's nothing that can break me. And I learned that for sure from the military. Alright. Did you ever see combat? No, thank God. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? Not easy. I would say that I, had I joined, had I went to college and pursued that path, things would be considerably different. it. You get out of the military and one thing they don't tell you, the whole thing about the GI Bill that they'll help pay for college, but that's for like vocational schools and stuff like that. You don't really know that. And I'm not a vocational school guy. The jobs aren't quite the same. You're kind of a little bit older and you already missed that early window to get in on a good career so a lot of people don't don't end up where they might have intended to be before they join the military put it that way bunch of jobs different jobs telemarketing pizza delivery I sold phones for Verizon Wireless, warehousing, I've done different things and of course traveled for my daughter. Well for one like I said no matter what comes it no matter what comes my way I know I'll be okay especially physically but just endurance mental endurance after sleeping in the dirt and waking up in freezing sleeping bags and digging holes and and and sweating to no end and 20 mile you know humps stuff like that life no matter how hard it gets it's still a piece of cake for me most people wouldn't say that How have you been feeling lately? I think the economy is a big downer for a lot of people. Have you ever studied to be a senior believer or a doctor? No. No, I'm pretty good. I'd say I'm getting a little bit better, actually. Like I said, I just learned to persevere. No matter how hard it gets, I'll be okay. I'll be all right. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty good. I do sleep well. Most, most nights. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm usually still pretty good. I may be a little bit, a tad bit sluggish, but... If I don't sleep well, it's usually just for the night. The next night I'll sleep fine. And... Yeah, I'm usually alright still. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Oh no, you probably didn't hear me, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. When was the last time you felt really happy? of things that I understand that he wants to understand. We went for a ride afterwards which always makes me feel good. So yeah, two days ago. That's good. Yes, it was good. What's been a positive influence in your life? Mostly authors and musicians. Paolo Coelho. Radiohead. stuff like that intelligent articulate he said something about he said the reason I talk to you is because you know so much something like that because I know a lot most times it's riding my bike uh just now i took i think it was 15 miles to get here roughly and um i like to just see if i can do that how how hard and we hadn't ridden i hadn't ridden my bike in like two months so i was curious what it was going to feel like for my legs uh endurance and all that and uh as i'm riding and i got it in the best gear and i'm just cranking along on the road you know on the freeway whatever um that feels great that's accomplishment that's physical uh you know i'm building myself i like doing that Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? childhood and all that and come out the other side and not be violent and not be abusive to learn from those things. A lot of people get stuck. I know it. And I didn't. I learned to turn that around. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Very good. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Very good. And I'm going to stop recording. Sure. You can also leave that number. Thank you. No, not live.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/712_P/712_AUDIO.wav,1

Anything? tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make hardest decision college maybe deciding what I want to major in in college you know Yes. Did you read my papers? 20.

715,55,2," Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And when she's finished, just push it. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? So-so. Where are you from originally? I'm born and raised in Los Angeles, California. California native. What are some things you really like about LA? The beach. The nice scenery. shopping sunlight some people gain violence work ethics for being employable under different circumstances for scoring the prison and things like that You know, you have to cut through a lot of red tape in order to get back, you know, in the standings that you were in once before you went to prison. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? For the last two years, I haven't been traveling because I haven't had a car. But other than that, I do travel. Locally and just around here. I don't travel from state to state. I don't have that type of money yet. Seeing the scenery, meeting different people, seeing, you know, their different states and how they're built, you know, the housing, different structures like that. I'd like to know about one of your trips. Well, for instance, when I went to Virginia, when I was in the service, I liked going to Petersburg and Richmond. It was nice there. The people and the shopping. Back then in those days, things were a lot cheaper. You could buy things at a reasonable price. economy was you know down there and everything was reasonable. I enjoyed being on the army grounds when I was in Virginia. I really enjoyed that. One of my major studies was mathematics. I was real good at math. Besides other general, you know, general education. But math was one of my stronger subjects. What do you do now? I've just started to go to college today. Today was my first day. I'm studying computers and designing. I'm going to see what I can do with designing from there. Computers, I wanted to learn computers so I can have my own computer at home surf the web, the internet and all of that. Alright. What's your dream job? Well, I'm disabled now. I have severe back damage. I have a forward degenerating disc in my back. I don't think I'll be able to go back to work anytime soon. So if I could do anything with my hands, as I mentioned before, by designing clothes or something like that, I may be able to do that, you know, and put something on the market. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm an outgoing person. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my family. My mother, my sisters, my aunts, and I have an uncle left, you know, my cousins. We all get along good. Everybody lives their own life. You know, we have a tendency to, you know, stay in ourselves and get together every now and then, you know, when it's time for us to get together. Family reunions and things like that. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Watch a lot of television. I like westerns and different movies. I like to talk to lady friends. things like that very good real good at controlling my temper you have a tendency to take a lot and then you know something bothers me there there did something that happened in the past and you know I get some alcohol in me and kind of you know I had to get that out you know key from exploding you know busting something you know When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. Well, I kind of had it out with one of the staff members there. there you know he said something behind my back so I had to let him know where I stood at and and what he shouldn't have said I wish I wouldn't have said the words that I said to him but what's done is done so I can't take that back I have a lot of things I feel guilty about. A lot of things I've done in the past that I wish I hadn't done. But I can't change the past. So I have to live for today. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, I had to make a lot of hard decisions, but I can tell you one that I had to make. My nephew was living with me, which he thought he was going to be able to stay with me for over a period of time, and I had to let him go. Tell him that it's time for you to go. You have to man up and do what you have to do for yourself. Tell me about a thing or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. that's going to be there until I die or have it removed. I mean, it shows, so it's going to be there. Have you ever served in the military? Yes. Yes, I have. How old were you when you joined the military? Nineteen. How did you decide to move to the military? I had grew up. You were happy with that? Yes, yes I'm happy I did. I had grew up and become, you know, a young man and it was time for me to get out and start making my own way for myself. Alright. Did you ever see combat? No. No, I just got in at the end of the Vietnam War, which I tried to go in while it was still happening, but I was too young and they wouldn't let me go in. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? I really didn't have that much of a problem adjusting to it but I really missed being in the military you know as far as being on active duty I wish I would have stayed in there instead of coming back home so quick you know but by me being married I came back to my wife and my marriage didn't last long so that messed me up so I just had to spin my wheels for a while That's good. What did you do after the military? I went to work. I worked in the Naval shipyard. I worked as a mechanic. And I worked doing construction work and also parks and recreation well it gave me a different outlook on life as far as the things that i was doing as a young man it just turned me just completely around backwards, go the other way, you know, do things right in my life instead of what I was doing, hanging out in the streets, drinking, you know, with my friends and stuff like that. So that was a really big help for me. I'm sorry. How have you been feeling lately? Um, living life on life terms. I mean, if that's a good enough answer, living life on life terms, trying to make it day by day, and stay out of the way, stay out of harm's way. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. Nothing I can think of right off the top of my head, no. Sometimes it varies. I may get three to four nights okay and then other nights I'm up and anxious waiting to go and do what I have to do the following day and sometimes I just don't sleep. I'd get up and watch television, drink coffee, smoke cigarettes, and think. I'd say mouth. It's some form, but I didn't follow through with it. You know, they wanted to give me all them different medications and things like that. I took some of them, but then I stopped because it was putting me in a whole different atmosphere. And with the brain I have left, I wanted to keep it and use it. How long ago were you diagnosed? Probably like five years but more of in like the last year pass seeing different psychiatrist. I guess more of more of depression, my surroundings, the area that I was living in, played a big part of that. Tell me more about that. Well, when you live around people that, you know, are in gangs and stuff and shooting up and down your street all the time and you see four or five, six people get killed within a three-month period on your street, I mean, that's heartbreaking. and your heart goes out to them people. You know, and you see these people go up and down the street every day and you don't know who's who and what's what. So it's something you have to live with and you have to be on your guard at all times. How do you cope with them? Pass them by. Wave and keep going about your business. Can you tell me about that? Well, I really don't have an answer for it because a lot of times you don't conversate with those type of people. You just pass them by. What got you to seek help? help because I had got depressed and started using alcohol and drugs and you know wanted to change my environment and also changed myself so I needed to take myself out of that situation and put myself in a different environment and start over again No, I don't. No, I haven't been to therapy since April of this year. And that was in a group setting. Is this therapy useful? Yes, it is. If you use the materials, the tools that they give you is very useful. Tell me more about that. Well, for instance, if somebody gives you some advice to not do a certain thing, and you do that certain thing, which they don't warn you not to do that, then you're going to kick your own self in the behind. So it would be better if you take the advice and not do that thing and you know the results. And a lot of times you have traveled down that road before. It's no good for you. It's a dead end. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, I've been utilizing some of the material that they've given me. You know, instead of keep going on the roller coaster ride, you know, just leave that part of life alone and live life on life terms. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? Wow. That's been a long time. Really, really felt happy. It's been a long time. I couldn't answer that question for you. I mean, I couldn't. It's been years.

I'm still trying to try different ones. Apparently there's enough out there that I can go through. How long ago were you diagnosed? Maybe more than a year ago. About a year ago from my depression. What were your symptoms? Isolation. Not really talking with anybody. I wouldn't really be so like a people person. Communication was at an all-time low. I would be mainly staying at the house. I wouldn't be going out. I wouldn't be doing events or doing the things that I would like to do. that also goes along with my addiction as well are you triggered by something? that's one thing I can't figure out is what the hell triggered them why am I like this why am I actually doing the things or did the things that I do or did becoming an addict not communicating well with my family I wasn't like this before How do you cope with them? I don't know The only thing I got on my side is the gym It's the one place that I know I can release a lot of tension The one place where I know I don't have to talk to people But we're all together They're doing the same thing We're all doing the same thing Exercising Getting physically well It's the only place where I know that I can relax.

Depending what the topic is or we're probably talking about the same thing over again. Okay. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? since you've been going to therapy? The changes that I've noticed, maybe a little bit less stress knowing that I have a couple more skills or tools to cope with my depression, PTSD. Not knowing when I'm going to have an outburst, controlling myself here and there. But it's a long process. Also, all my recovery is going to be a forever process. That's good. When was the last time you felt really happy? When I made up with my girlfriend. That was, what, two days ago? We argued, and I talked about it with her, and she was able to hear me out, and I was able to hear her out, We fixed things, so that was the happiest moment so far. That's great.

Yeah, he did tell me something like that, and I do consider him my best friend. Pretty cool that he said that. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Recently, what I really enjoyed? Fishing. I went with my friend Mikey fishing. We caught a couple fish. Very quiet. Very fun. Kind of, you got to be patient. But it is relaxing. It does take the edge off. No one there to talk to. No one there to be around out in the open. Yeah, that's it. What are you most proud of in your life? That's yet to come. I'm waiting for it. Okay.

717,20,1," Okay. Let me get this all shut down. If you notice that she pauses for more than about 20, 30 seconds, go ahead and press that button. It may be an indication that something's gone wrong so I can come and check it out. Okay. So now I'm going to bring up our virtual human. You'll be able to see them here. I'm going to go ahead and start up our recording equipment. Once again, after she says goodbye, go ahead and press this button, and I'll come back in for you, okay? Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Absolutely. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Doing good. Enjoying the weather. Where are you from originally? Houston, Texas. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather, the beach, marijuana. What are some things you don't really like about your life? I can't think of nothing really. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? No, I used to. I used to be a truck driver, but now I'm a student at LA Trade Tech, so I'm home base now. What do you enjoy about traveling? Scenery, meeting different people. I'd like to hear about one of your trips. I had an experience when I went to North Carolina. Being there for the weekend, the atmosphere was great. It's a different beach type lifestyle I imagine, the party life is different. There's a lot of clubs over there. So I really had a nice time during the weekend that I was there. Met a lot of nice people, got laid. It's just a good memory. What's one of your most memorable experiences? That's great. What did you study at school? Diesel technology. I'm learning how to do, how to be a repair technician for like the buses, diesel trucks. Anything that's running off diesel, they've taught me how to repair engines, take them apart and put them back together, troubleshooting the electrical work. I'm really enjoying it because I like doing things with my hands and the things that they're teaching me I can use it for the rest of my life you know I really it's something that I can probably pass on to others so you know I really like it right now leisure time I ride my bike a lot you know going different parts of LA a lot of times I go to the beach I like Venice and Santa Monica Beach a lot. Actually just seeing this country, not the country but the city. There's a lot of places I haven't been. I don't have a driver's license but just being able to ride my bike and go where I want to, I really love that. Alright. What's your dream job? My dream job? Motorcycle racing. Riding a motorcycle. Super bike racing. That's my dream job. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Tell me about your relationship with your family. Me and my family, we're distant. I'm in touch with my dad, but as far as cousins and my mom, we don't talk. Smoke some weed and go to sleep. control your temper? My zodiac sign is a Taurus so it takes a lot to make me angry but if it's something that I know is someone has done something wrong I just simply try to tell them about it to correct them but being physical I try not to get into that but you know you got people out there that really don't care about your feelings so sometimes I end up walking away not dealing with them anymore. Uh oh. I'm going through a divorce. I just experienced a domestic violence incident where me and her got in an argument about who's going to clean the house. So I took it upon myself to, I punched in the shoulder and called the police on myself. Spent two days in jail. I've been ordered out of the home. It's been since January, so right now I'm working on my divorce. I wish the best for her and the family. I mean, it's no hard feelings about it. They're not homeless. They have an apartment now, and they're doing good. But I feel that she should have been more friendly about the way we broke up because she changed the locks on the apartment, and I didn't get a chance to get any of my tools and put in paperwork, birth certificate and whatnot. She still has that. But, you know, I feel like I better pick my life up and continue on. You know, I don't wish nothing bad about her. Hopefully she's happy. I know that she's with the baby's daddy. He's come from Louisiana. He's staying with her now. And, you know, it's, how would I put it? I'm not mad about it. I'm more hurt. The hurt feeling is what it is. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. But when I done that, my daddy called it putting all my ducks in the basket where she's got my social security number, my information and everything. I just opened myself up to her, which I felt was a waste of time. It was a bad move. But, you know, life goes on. What's something you feel guilty about? guilt feeling i mean guilt come from doing stuff that you know you shouldn't have done uh... i don't do that in life i don't steal i mean i live by the bible so guilt i don't have that The hardest decision? I just make decisions actually out of a reaction in a sense. It's not hard for me to make a decision. That's not like me. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Dealing with women, they're basically the wrong women. I know that in the future that women are different, that the ones who have done such is that individual. It's not an all woman type thing. But right now in my life, I just need the right one. I don't like being by myself. I felt that me being married would alleviate that. But I married the wrong one evidently. Hopefully that if I decide to take that step again that it'll be the right one this time because you know You know you're getting old and time done went by and you can't bring that back Yes, I'm a veteran How I feel? Can you tell me about that? I never thought about it, but I feel good. I mean, I'm healthy. I'm just glad, you know, my freedom. Me being black, you really think about the fact of the race being locked up a lot. The history. And I feel that me, I'm doing good. So, you know, to me, I'm happy about life. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? My association with women is different. I don't, like, hold conversation with women I don't know like I used to. It's hard for me to, like, how would you say, start a relationship or friendship, rather, with a female. Now, when it comes to men, I'm not gay and I don't do gay things so we don't get that out of the way. But as far as men, you know, I don't have friends but when it comes to being advice, you know, I experience that a lot. I got a few students, classmates rather, that kind of like lean toward me when it comes to, how would you say, me helping them and I kind of like get in trouble for that. So I guess you would say me being outgoing rather, thinking about other people more than myself. My dad told me it's time for me to start thinking about me. So I'm trying to get my mind into that frame where, you know, I'm just concentrating on bettering life for myself now. Uh-huh. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? If I don't know what I had to do during the day, it's no problem. But I sometimes worry about the next day and about what's going to happen or how I'm going to handle it. the thought. You know, you sometimes get to dreaming about how things are going to be and if it goes to where, you know, the dream leads to a dead end or a bad situation, you'll wake up from it. It's not considered a nightmare, but my body, I wake up. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't sleep well. I'm not doing the day. I mean I'm not irritable. Emotionally I'm stable. But I don't have problems sleeping. If I sit too long in one spot and I know that I'm going to be there for more than 30 minutes, I can go to sleep. It's no problem for me. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. No depression. When was the last time you felt really happy? When me and the ex-wife and the kids were at the beach. We was all having a good time. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Positive influence? I really can't think of any. Wait, slow down. Positive influence, that would be my daddy. I mean, you know, he's made it through life and done a lot of good things for people where he can sit back now and not really worry about things. He's just taking his last few days one day at a time in a sense. He's really concerned about how I'm doing because of some of the decisions I made. When it gets to the point where I run into a problem, I'll call him and he'll give me advice about it. And sometimes I don't do what he asks me to do or tell me to do to make him mad. Especially when it comes to females. I would say my dad. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend? My best friend. I would be that. I guess... Talk about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Nice. Wait, slow down. It's hard to think of that kind of stuff. I really don't pay attention to it. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm most proud of... But I still have the desire to continue. I'm proud of that. I mean, life's been good. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Goodbye to you too. Thank you. you you you Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/717_P/717_AUDIO.wav,1
718,29,1," Maybe an indication that something's gone wrong and I just want to make sure I can come back over and fix it. How long should this portion last? This will probably be about 15 minutes. Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and bring up our virtual view. There she is. I'm going to go ahead and bring up our virtual group. There she is. All right. Okay. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It's a Friday. That's great. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from Alabama, from the Gulf Coast, and born and raised out there. I'm going to put my glasses on here. I like the weather in general. It does get kind of hot and sometimes it's a little overbearing, but I like that you could go from the beach within an hour to the mountains. So that's pretty diverse, I guess. So I like that. What are some things you don't really like about the valley? I don't like the traffic. Sometimes it's just crazy and unbearable. I also don't like the weather conditions given the smog and so forth, which can be a little bit, if you live in the valley, it's just a big heat bulb, so it can be a little bit unbearable as well. I used to travel a lot. When I was in the Army, I lived in Germany, so I used to travel every chance I could take. Every weekend, I would travel throughout Germany. Now, so much so, I don't travel as much since I'm married and so forth, but I used to travel more or less more international than anything. What do you enjoy about traveling? museum or whatever. I remember when I went to South Africa when I was in Cape Town, it's the same thing. You know, you're reading a lot of books in the context, and then you go and you see it, and it's like, wow, you know, it's not just getting it off the internet or anything like that, so I enjoy that. I'd like to know about one of your trips. um okay well i uh a couple years back i was in south africa and i was doing research for for for college and so i was there working for a private equity firm and even before i got there i read uh nelson mandela's book which is this 500 page biopic kind of thing and i'm actually making it into a movie but i read it and i was like you know i'm going to check this out so i went to robin island which was pretty cool um where um it was kept for about 25 30 years and the city reminds me of san francisco if you've ever been to san francisco but the city reminds me of san francisco uh there are steep bluffs right off the coast uh and then there's the indian ocean there but i enjoyed it i i had a i had a great great time taking in the sites and you get to see a lot of the Dutch colonial stuff and you know and all that kind of just mixed in together and there's great wine they have a lot of great vineyards vineyards down in that part of South Africa in Cape Town Cape Town is great. Cape Town or just in general or in traveling. At school I studied I studied business I studied finance and accounting so I I kind of had a minor in military studies or military science is what it was called in undergrad but for the most part I studied finance and in grad school I studied finance and accounting I I write and I do consulting so I do consulting for finance so I do about 50 50 writing and then consulting stuff My dream job is to be JJ Abrams. So that's my dream job. Actually, I would love to just kind of do something more creative. Well, actually, what I consider is creative is the thing that interests me. I love finance because finance is creative, believe it or not. you get to create all these different packages and bundle them and derivatives that's no different from writing to me you know so it's the same thing so I just want to do something that's kind of creative and that kind of aligns to just looking at new things in a different way and that's the way I've always been Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? read a book as opposed to, you know, you know, watching TV or playing the Xbox or whatever. So that's, that's me. Why? Why? Because the other stuff doesn't seem as interesting. You know, I think there's a lot of things that are really interesting. and using your imagination and picking up a book, it's just kind of raw. It's unfiltered kind of thing. So that's me. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a great relationship with my family. I have a wife and kids. I also have a family that's back in Alabama and Georgia. And for my immediate family, we, you know, I have to divide my time between my only interest and my family. But we do a lot of great things that are centered around the kids. My wife is more or less an East Coaster, so she's from the New York area. so we do things that are centered around her and then we do things for the kids because the kids have interest so we we I just try to to balance it and I have my stuff too so I'm kind of last but we do have a lot of diverse interests which is great take screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax um what do i do to relax i i would might i'd like to go i i like i'm i think i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm more of a late back kind of guy. I mean, I'm that kind of guy, you know, I'm a little bit, you know, you just, you know, at some point, you know, enough is enough. But I'm pretty, I'm pretty polished in how I have done, you know, you know, being an army, been an army officer when I was in the military and going through all the cadet training and stuff. You really do a lot in how you interact with management and so forth. So I'm okay with my temper. Everybody has their breaking point. And what I do to relax, I like to go for a walk mostly. I like to be outside. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I'll probably say I argued with... Tell me about that. Yeah, sure. I could say I argued with my wife and it probably was about something related to the kids or the kids and money or something like that. We have four kids and are great kids, but kids are a little expensive at times. And so I don't remember what it was, but it was a ballet class or something like that. And it wasn't necessarily free. I'll put it that way. And, you know, so we kind of we had an argument about it because it was just one of those things where, you know, my wife, you know, you know, you know, she if the kid has an interest in anything related to anything, it's like, oh, let's let's invest all of this and let's see what happens. So, you know, after a while, you're like, okay, fine. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Whatever comes to mind. A situation I wish I would have handled differently. What's something you feel guilty about? I would probably say. What was the hardest decision you've ever had to make? Oh, okay. That's even. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was when I was in the Army and I had to fire someone who had been in the service for 15 years. That was pretty tough. because this person went out and he had, I guess, made a bad decision. He had a DUI, and he had a family, and he had people that depended on him, and we had to remove him from his position. And I was a junior officer at the time, and I was in charge with doing the firing. So it was kind of weird. So, you know, you know, and this is someone you go out, you have beer with or a drink with and and the next day, you know, you got to fire this person. So that was hard because, you know, it's one of those things where you you really, you know, one of the things about the military, you always hear the stories of where you shouldn't, I guess, been an officer. You shouldn't be so involved with your peers or your subordinates and that sort of thing. And it was true for me because I was a cool laid-back kind of guy. And when it's time to make decisions like that, they're tough and they're personal because you realize that you're affecting someone's livelihood. And that's tough. All right. Tell me about Mid-Nove or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Have you ever served in the military? Yes, I've served in the military. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I've been okay. Some days are great. Some days are crappy. But on average, they're okay. It's not so what I call swingy in a way. Have you ever studied changes in your behavior or thought process? Not lately. I do feel that the older I get, I'm just more impatient about certain things. You think that when you're younger, you're more impatient. It's okay. I can easily, there's some nights that are better than others I guess. I find that I can get a good night's sleep when I go to bed at a certain time. If I go to bed too early, it's not good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? My faculties are not all there. I need more to become engaged throughout my day and I'm easily distracted. Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I have not. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I felt really happy, I can say last weekend. Although I did have some down moments, but it was my wedding anniversary, and I took the wife and kids, went to Disneyland, and I guess it is the happiest place on earth, whatever. But we had a good time. It's more or less because my kids were having a good time, and they really had a blast. My kids are in that really young age where everything is fun for them, so that makes me happy. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? it's always good to have that in your corner because you're going to get rejection enough. But to have someone support you in your decisions is always good. How would your best friend describe you? I think my best friend would probably say that I'm a hard worker. I have a strong work ethic that I'm generally someone who is responsible and, you know, easygoing kind of guy, well-liked guy. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? that's great. I mean, he's eight and, and it's just great, you know, and it's good because one day he's going to grow up and he's going to have a kid of his own or have a family of his own. And so, you know, I, I think the best thing that I can do is give him that example of what it's like to, to be a dad and to be responsible. That's something I never, I never had, I never saw. So I'm kind of, it's not like I have a textbook to go back and reference or anything, but I think, you know, it makes me proud because you have, um, little minds that you're shaping, you know, little people that, that see what you're doing and, and, and that kind of want to be like you. So that's kind of cool. You're welcome. Goodbye. Thank you.",/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/339_P/718_P/718_AUDIO.wav,0
